0,2018-10-05,4.0,"I went here last week with my friend for the oyster happy hour. We order the $16 dollars with wine and 3 types of oysters in a total of 6. I have been quite a lot ""oyster bar"" in the city and I had not been impressed by any of them.Upstate, on the other hand, surprised me a lot by its freshness and taste. All 3 kinds of oysters were tasted fresh with a scent of ocean and salty. I ate them aside with a few drops of lemon, that's all you need when you are eating fresh seafood!We had ordered some other main courses as well but they were just regular with no surprise. In bottom line, I would highly recommend you to try for their oysters!",18.40666666666667,0.18589743589743593

All 3 were from east coast and was really good. I also liked how it came with all 3 sauces (cocktail, horseradish, Mignonette). Other spots we've encountered in NY didn't.  The complimentary whisky cake tasted like pound cake with slight bitter notes, moist and delicious! Highly recommended! As they serve quality oysters for great price during happy hour and not your regular cheap Blue Point oysters.",18.40666666666667,0.37061403508771934
3,2018-09-26,1.0,"Fresh oysters but ultra rude staff. Yes don't waste your time to book reservation online because they will not honor that. We had to wait more another 40 mins. It's ok if the hostess was friendly, but she was not. The waiter told us we had 1 minute to order happy hour menu once we sat. It's a game? He threw the pen and paper to our table. When my friend looked at the bill before we paid the bill I heard the waiter said ""keep looking "". What an attitude!  I understand you were very busy, but if you can't handle this . Don't be in this work field. Thousand of restaurants in New York. I ll never go back to this place!",18.40666666666667,0.15830578512396692

We sat at the bar and tried a half dozen perfectly executed plates and ate until we literally could no more! Finished with the pasta and what a great choice it was. The Bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable. He actually gave us some smoked salmon and creme fraiche bites with caviar that weren't on the menu.

10,2018-09-12,5.0,"I wish I had taken pictures!  Gluten free is no problem here, and I left with a full belly which can be a problem at some of the more trendy restaurants.  Also the prices didn't break the bank making it all the more attractive.We started with a happy hour oyster plate that came with a beer.  I had the 2 from Prince Edward Island, and they were so exceedingly fresh like a taste of the sea.  They were so good, our party ordered more.  For entree's, one of us got the linguini with clam sauce, and the clams were laid on top on the shells-it was devoured! But not gluten free...Another got Ciopino soup and I believe was gluten free.  The mussels, oysters, clams all came in the shells accompanied by fish, shrimp and scallops in a tomato broth. Delish!I got the scallops prepared gluten free and dairy free, they came on a bed of risotto full of mushrooms prepared in fish stock.  A very generous dish, I couldn't finish.

11,2018-09-08,5.0,"Even though everything was over salted, I'm still giving them 5 stars because the seafood was amazing!Small space and I'm assuming usually packed (they don't take reservations), you should get here early. I was lucky to find a seat at the bar. I had the crab cakes which were delicious - it's the kind of crab cakes where you have nice shredded crab cake meat and no fillers. I followed that with the scallops over mushroom risotto. The scallops were totally over salted but otherwise well cooked. The mushroom risotto was one of the best I've ever had. My pale ale was light and refreshing. I ordered the monk fish to go and enjoyed it the next day. Great flaky fish that was well cooked and would have been perfect just like the scallops had it not been excessively salted.

12,2018-09-08,5.0,"Great happy hour oysters, beer and wine specials. In addition, this is a spot that has amazing and tasty dinner a la carte (we tried the tartare, uni toast, mushroom risotto). Though the tartare didn't hit the spot for me, my friend really enjoyed it. We all liked the uni toast and it didn't taste fishy (had some meh uni toasts elsewhere and they were double the price), mushroom risotto was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Small restaurant so on a Friday it can get super busy early. Advice: line up at 4:50 to wait patiently. They are fully seated by 5:15 during summer fridays... then you'll have to wait for the next seating. Wine we ordered (Sauvignon Blanc) paired well with the oysters and my friends liked the variety of beers.

13,2018-09-03,5.0,"I LOVE this place!! If you want a meal that showcases fresh seafood and highlights seasonality, then look no further! I usually go with some of my girlfriends on Sundays right when it opens at 5PM. This place is ALWAYS packed, so there is a line before it opens because the seating is very limited. We usually end up sitting at the bar. Atmosphere: rustic open air vibe (literally the front of the restaurant is open to the street) Food: Happy hour deal - 6 oysters + craft beer for $12 (you can pay extra to have wine instead). They have a great selection of fresh oysters! Fettuccine with clams - absolutely divine. Perfectly cooked pasta with a delicious blend of garlic, olive oil, and parmesan coating every bite. We get this every time! Honorable mentions: crab cakes (crispy but soft on the inside, and you can really taste the crab) and charred squid salad (mmm squid enough said) Service: very attentive and knowledgeable!

Left my number and forty minutes later there were only two parties waiting before us. At that time we already started dining at another restaurant.

18,2018-08-25,4.0,"This is one of the busiest restaurants in East Village as it doesn't take reservations, and is well known for serving great value seafood dishes. My boyfriend and I came on a Thursday at the beginning of summer. It was early in the evening but there was already a line, though the waitress cited 20 minutes for us. We stood outside waiting with the hungry hordes of city-dwellers, and thanked our lucky stars when she called us before 20 minutes had passed. The waitress who took our orders was pleasant, and our food was out within 20 minutes. We had a mix of the oyster (on the list of oyster happy hour) and uni toast for appetizers. The uni toast was amazingly delicious with the egg yolk, and I've never had the likes of such a dish before. It was the standout of the night. The other dishes we had, the fettuccine with clams, and the seafood stew, were delicious, flavorsome and well-cooked, but not amazing. However, they were great quality dishes at modest prices compared to other places in the city. Would recommend.",14.754166666666668,0.36547619047619045
19,2018-08-24,5.0,"As other reviewers had stated - expect a wait..but then it was a beautiful end of summer Friday night.  You can make a space on their waiting list when your within a mile from it by using your Yelp app. It worked great.While we waited, we went to the Latin place next door for a few drinks and an appetizer while we waited. It was really good as well! When it was close for us to be seated, my app texted me to let me know. Expect close dining quarters. My DH had a dozen oysters and ordered the clam fettuccine for his main. I had the scallop and mushroom risotto. My DH and I go to Maine yearly (for the seafood and a getaway) and we have been to Boston Mass and New Orleans and he has had some ""amazing"" oysters and some just so so. He said these were shucked perfectly, no shell no sand. And he said they were the best he's had...His clam fettuccine was great. A lightly salty brine taste and cheese without being to overly cheesy. Smaller portions, but perfect when you take the train in - who wants to take some seafood on the train for an hour! My risotto and scallops were delish. The scallops were prepared well. Lightly seasoned and seared perfectly. No grittiness and the risotto was creamy and delish as well. The beers were ok..sorry we missed the $12 happy hour - 1/2 doz oysters and a beer from 5-7. Get there 15 minutes before they open if you don't want to wait.",13.795833333333334,0.2651515151515152

22,2018-08-18,5.0,Incredible little restaurant. Thank you for participating in Waitlist - it makes it so much easier to enjoy the food you serve. I love their happy hour menu which I believe is between 5-7. Correct me if I'm wrong. Their oysters are so delish and my fave is their fettuccine and clam. It's so creamy and works perfectly with the clams (which they give so much of!). My dad LOVES oysters and left this place so full and content. So did my brother. The prices are pretty reasonable. Service is attentive and fast. See you in the future!,21.591891891891887,0.29765625
23,2018-08-12,4.0,"Basically THE spot for HH oysters of quality. The deal includes either beer or wine with oysters so unfortunately if you're not drinking, you can truly participate (granted I never asked). Food is DELICIOUS but very small portions. Had the clams fettuccine and trout. Overall the pasta was kind of salty but tasty (very heavy) and the trout was light and fresh. The trout comes with two long gnocchi which are SO HEAVENLY to contrast the fish. Ceviche was small for sure but tasty. At the end they bring out a couple of slices of their whiskey cake.

30,2018-07-22,5.0,"Even though it's hard to get reservations, do whatever you can to get here. I came late after work one night, and thankfully was able to sit alone at the bar which was actually the biggest perk as I was able to chat with the bartender/manager and learn so much more about this amazing restaruaunt. Even for a party of 1, I still needed a reservation ahead of time (which you can make on yelp). It is very small, only seating for a few tables, and is intimate but not fancy. It has a rustic vibe, but decor is simple. The menu overall changes basically every night depending on where they are able to get the fresh fish, which is mostly from coastal New England. First off, the oysters are delicious. Many options, always rotating based on what is fresh. The appetizers also change constantly, and thankfully the bartender was able to give me a few to sample (stuffed peppers with tuna, scallops). The go to order is the linguine and clams, which is not a typical thing that I would order. However, NYC Kim is trying new things, so I tried it, and was pleasantly surprised. It was delicious, flavorful, buttery. The clams were fresh, over 10, and to my surprise I enjoyed them. The fettuchine was fresh and homemade. I don't know what Gster would have got if he came, because they basically only have seafood on the menu. They give a complintary whiskey cake for dessert which is dense, flavorful and cleanses the pallate from the seafood flavor. While the food here is certainly well worth the visit, the overall experience is a 'classic' NYC restaurant, where the owner clearly has a vision, following his dream, a true art to flavor and culinary perfection. They have made a great business out of his love for good seafood.",22.13018867924528,0.24465921675223995

Not just a happy hour bar.  If you are only coming for oysters you are missing out.Shane the owner is always there and takes so much pride in offering the freshest fish, and now some more exotic dishes.  I remember him saying back in the day they don't own a freezer, which speaks to how fresh everything always is.  And just last week he told me he is now branching out from purely local fish...just a bit...to do some other exciting things on the menu. Friday night it was Marlin, which was served as a crudo, but being such a rich fish, came across more like a seafood version of carpaccio.

I thought the pasta and sauce itself was a bit bland, but they give you enough clams that there's one in every bite and it's delicious.

45,2018-07-02,5.0,"A rough approximation of my conversation with the gentleman behind the bar who took great care of us the other night:Me to bartender: ""It's probably been almost ten years since I was last here.""Bartender: ""What took you so long to come back?""Me: ""There are just so many places to eat in New York. It's difficult to make it back to the same place you've already been, even when you remember liking it.""Bartender: ""I hear that - I live on 9th St. and I regularly stumble across places that make me go, 'That wasn't here last week.'""Me: ""Speaking of a long time... Have you been working here long?Bartender: ""Yeah, I've been working here a pretty long time...""Me: ""How long's long?""Bartender: ""From day one.""Me: ""Oh! No wonder you seem so familiar, I feel like I recall you from when I was last here ages ago.""Bartender: ""That's not surprising, I'm the owner.""Aside from some mild awkwardsauce, it's extremely clear that said establishment owner runs a tight ship. My initial visit to Upstate nearly a decade ago is lost in the mists of my memory, but I clearly recalled enjoying myself. On this particularly steamy summer evening where J and I both wanted a relatively light dinner, I stumbled across Upstate when looking up nearby dinner options. Not only could I remotely get in line via YelpRez, I know he loves oysters and I hadn't been back in awhile. All of the signs aligned and we're so glad we made the trek over.Our seats became available within about ten minutes of arrival and were affably welcomed to two seats at the bar by the hostess. Who knew we'd be served most of the evening by Upstate's very proprietor?!Not only was he very friendly and patient with our many questions about the menu, he was also extremely knowledgeable, flawlessly offering recommendations on what to order (pro tip: we had the marlin crudo and shark at his recommendation, but it's probably safe to just go with whatever's fresh).I'm not as big on oysters as J is, but we went in on a dozen, two of each kind from all up and down the coast. I have to say that this tasting exercise was fun and enlightening, though! I discovered that I prefer brinier oysters in general. Winners for me were the Pemaquid and Dunbar Farms. The Dodge Cove oysters were impressively huge, but I'm no size queen - give me a delicious and manageable mouthful; I'd rather not spend half an hour chewing to get food down my throat.We were pleasantly surprised at the end of our meal with an unexpected plate of whiskey cake! It reminded me of pound cake, but made for a perfectly satisfying semi-sweet ending to our light yet satisfying meal (paired with some milk stout).I definitely need to wait less than ten years before making a return run to Upstate. And if J's reaction is any indication, he might drag me back much much sooner, too.",21.183333333333334,0.15072045506828116

There's enough seating that the wait moves fairly efficiently. Pro tip: put yourself on the waitlist via Yelp ~30-40 minutes before you want to dine. Super easy!We started with a selection of east & west coast oysters. The waitress recommended them and she had really great picks for us based on what we said we liked. For starters we got the uni and scallop ceviche, would recommend both - they both had great flavors and the ceviche has a bit of a kick to it. I got the fettuccine with clams and my friend got the tuna. We both cleaned our plates (we were so full after), generous and delicious portions, and they treated us to complimentary whiskey bread at the end of the meal which was SO good (drenched in butter ... but that's how to do it right!)I'll definitely be back for the oyster happy hour!",16.625,0.4222222222222223

They had 3 types of oysters that are included in the special so we ordered 4 of each. We agree our favorite oyster was the one from Seattle (versus the east coast ones that were offered). I'd get 6 of just those next time. Then we got the charred squid salad and uni appetizers. Both were on point. Would recommend for anyone who can appreciate calamari that is unbreaded and unfried. It is served over a bed of kale with some lemon aioli or the likes. The uni was served with a raw egg and bread. Our waiter recommended mixing it all together and soaking the bread in it. Would get that again for sure. For entree, we got the fettucine clams and the mahi mahi. The mahi mahi was a little salty for my taste. The fettucine clams looks like a small serving but it is rich of butter and cheese. Very filling and definitely have to share it. But very delicious. Perfectly al dente and the clams complemented it well. Didn't have space for dessert but they brought out complimentary whiskey lemon cake (I think?), and it was a perfect ending.",20.503703703703703,0.3796676362852833

Ok, so they have a really good happy hour deal, oysters and beer for a good price.  Sure the oysters are fresh and yes they were tasty, but that's because they have good quality oysters. So I think the high reviews are in regards to the happy hour, if that's so, sure then 4-5 stars from me! But this review is to discuss the food we ordered off the menu.  I was not impressed by anything and it sure was not a memorable meal.  Their menu was seasonal.  We ordered the fettuccine with clams and the cioppino.  Both were just okay, in fact, pretty bland in my opinion.  The fettuccine was cooked well, slightly al dente, and it was topped with a lot of clams cooked in a buttery, garlic and some type of cheese.  If you are a lover of clams, then this dish will be perfect for you.  For me, I wanted more of the butter garlic taste to pair with the claims and pasta.  I didn't get that. The cioppino was a huge miss!  It was missing a lot of flavors that is usually present in a bowl of cioppino.  Lots of seafood - clams. mussels, shrimp, and fish.  But the tomato based broth was lacking a lot of flavor.  It also came with a side of toast that you can dip in the sauce. I was pretty disappointed in the food.  I was still a bit hungry after we finished everything (since I didn't eat much of the food, which is rare for me) so I decided to save room for dessert.  Service was okay.

They were fresh and I believe there were three different styles to choose from.  $12 for 6 Oysters and a great draft is quite the steal.

I just think that this restaurant is highly over rated, the scallops were properly cooked but they use brown rice for the risotto which could be creative, however, it just tasted like wet brown rice, not too flavorful. The fettuccine was bad, it was overcooked, very greasy and weird tasting garlic sauce, no other flavors. (Clams were okay) Oh, almost forgot about the crab cakes!!!

I feel bad for the staff as they're often in the awkward position of having to try to push past the seated customers. Other than that, the staff is usually decent.

The restaurant was very small, dark, and loud. It wasn't a great place for catching up as I had to yell throughout to talk to someone across from me. We each order one Rhode Island oyster, which we all enjoyed and were very fresh. We had a trout appetizer which was overcooked and bland. However, my main entree, clams with fettuccine, was very bland. I appreciate that there were a good amount of clams and the reasonable price, but we had higher expectations due to the large amount of amazing reviews on yelp. I tried my friends scallops and they were better. I don't think I'd come back, but the scallops were the way to go.",-8.225,0.13504329004329005

The food was good, service was good, but the reviews were like PHENOMINAL. And this place had been on my list for like 2 years. Maybe because I was too excited - it was good but not life changing. I'm glad I came because I was really curious. I also recently traveled to Italy where seafood and pasta were obviously off the chain so maybe that's why. I think it's worth a try but I don't think I would necessarily come back.",-5.983333333333333,0.36500000000000005

The reataurant itself is small, but as they say, great things come in small packages. Firstly, the food. Oh my goodness the FOOD!!! *drool* My amazingly sexy man and myself ordered 3 different types of delectable oysters, all of which were recommended by the server and all of which were fresh and delicious! We also shared 2 small plates and a main course which turned out to be just the right amount of food for 2. We had the trout, cooked to perfection with a crispy skin and very fresh and tasty tomatoes, greens, and potato gnocchi in a tasty wine sauce....it was so good, we used the toasted bread they gave us to soak up the sauce! We also had the crab cakes which were werved on a bed of mixed lettuces and salad. The crab cakes were very nicely cooked, crispy on thr outside but not at all greasy. They are made of maine blue crabs, so they are softer than the crab cakes from california where they are made of dungeness crab. Our main dish were the sea scallops and mushroom risotto....DELICIOUS! scallops cooked perfectly and the risotto was full of mushrooms and rich and creamy. All dishes were fresh and hot and reasonably priced. I definitely think this restaurant is worth a try!!!",-10.7125,0.2830811011904762

The crab cakes were a decent size and had good flavor. I also enjoyed the salad they were served with.Unfortunately, they had run out of the fish of the day (mahi mahi) by the time we got there, so I ended up getting a scallop dish. The scallops were cooked well, but I wish they had something a little more flavorful paired with them and the dish was a little small.Overall, this place is serious about seafood and does it well. It is pretty tiny, so be sure to get there early or be prepared to wait. The service was friendly and attentive and the food came out quickly.

Two seats opened up at the bar 15 mins after we left and it was perfection from there on out.  I asked for a side of pasta with my meal which wasn't exactly on the menu however, the bartender made it happen for me.  Everything was delicious and at the very end, someone must have noticed how much we loved trying new beers because a bartender sent us two tasters of their oyster porter beer.

95,2018-03-13,5.0,"This may be one of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan. With that said, please don't let their small menu deter you. I know they only have a couple of entrees listed on here, but they actually have a few more on their actual menu. Yep, there's not a lot of variety. But I can assure you that they have got those couple of dishes down to a tee. Or at the least the two that I tried!I came here for my girl's birthday and we had agreed to get here at 5 pm (right when they open) because they don't take reservations and there's always a long wait. My friend arrived at 5:02 pm and there was already a line! The tables were all taken and the wait for a table would take 1 hr- one and a half hr. She ended up snagging 6 seats at the bar for our group and we arrived a couple of minutes later.  The restaurant is extremely small and narrow. People sitting at the bar can see inside the kitchen. There were only 10 seats at the bar and a couple of tables. Bar customers can hang their belongings on the hooks behind them.After seeing how teeny tiny the place was, I understood why the menu was so small. The kitchen isn't that big and there aren't that many workers, hence it's best to keep things simple. Anyway, my friend really liked the happy hour oysters. The 5 of us got the scallop special which was DELICIOUS. The risotto tasted so earthy and went well with the mushrooms. I'm not a big fan of seafood but the scallops were well cooked. You could taste the natural sweetness of it. The portion isn't that big but just right for small eaters. Another friend got the fettuccine with clams. I got a taste of it and it was also a winner. However, I didn't get that cause I'm not a fan of clams. She said it was better than the scallop of the day special. At the end of our meal, they served us complimentary whiskey cake and even put a candle on it after we briefly mentioned it was our friend's birthday at the beginning. Super thoughtful and sweet! The cake was also very addicting! TLDR； Small place hence small menu. But the food was superb. Don't miss out! 10/10 would recommend!",-1.553191489361702,0.14822330447330445

Additionally, there was a cool feature where you check to see how many tables are ahead of you.  On both occasions, I've waited about an hour.  Usually once our name is in, we head down to d.b.a and grab some beers there.  The restaurant itself is not enormous.  Tables are tight, but you're not totally on top of each other.  The service is proactive and prompt.  While some of the menu can rotate, there were certain items that appear to always be there.  I'd highly suggest the tuna tartare and the smoked salmon.  Usually, I end up splitting a bunch of the appetizers and calling it a meal.  On my most recent visit, we tried the trout and gnocchi.  It was a very interesting mix of flavors and frankly one I would recommend and get again.  To go with the great food, there is a solid draft beer list as well as wine.

We each tried two of the three different available oysters on the hh menu, and all three were fantastic, but the Prince Edward Island oysters in particular were my favorite. I had heard that the black trout small plate was the best item on the menu, and please, if you order one thing, get. the. trout. Essentially, it's a thin, crispier version of salmon served in a delicious, light tomato sauce with a large almost-puréed gnocchi. We also ordered the crab cakes small plate, which were legitimately the best ones that I've ever had: not soggy, not made with excess sauce, crispy on the outside, no greens, and pure crab. I'd highly recommend those as well. For our entrees, we ordered the seafood bowl and the mahi steak. Both were delicious and perfectly simple. Just really, really good seafood that hit the spot. The service was phenomenal and the dimmer, quaint ambiance is perfect for any kind of date.I cannot recommend Upstate enough and will definitely be back!

From the food, to the service, to the ambiance, everything was perfect!We are both huge seafood fans so this place was made for us! We came at 5 on a Sunday night right when they opened and were able to grab a table with no wait. The restaurant is very small but we both really liked that. To start we got wine and a dozen of their happy hour oysters (4 each of the upstates own, the little shems and the oyster ponds) and none disappointed. For the wine we got the pinot noir and a sweet white and both were fantastic. As for the oysters, I think flavor wise the little shems were my favorite and I loved how large and meaty the oyster ponds were. I highly recommend all three of these! As an appetizer we got two small plates the crab cakes and the trout. Wow! I don't know which I liked better! The crab cakes are super meaty and crispy on the outside served over a great green salad with carrots and corn. The trout was cooked to perfection with an incredible crispy skin served with what seemed like little mashed potato logs and all swimming in the best tomato sauce I have ever had! For our entrees we got two large plates, the ciopinno and the mahi steak. The ciopinno was a delicious seafood stew of clams, mussels, the fish of the day, scallops and shrimp. It also came with a side of bread to soak up the stew and you can bet we wiped that bowl clean! The mahi steak was seared perfectly served over a bed of mashed potatoes and broccoli all covered in a great red sauce, that almost had the resemblance of cocktail sauce, and it worked all so well together! I highly recommend both of these dishes as well!My mouth is just watering remembering all the food we had and I can not wait to be back. Their menu changes constantly depending on the seafood available and I love that! My only regret is that my stomach isn't bigger so I could try more of the dishes.

All the fish was also nice and tender and not dry (sometimes a risk). Two items to improve, but are hard to avoid so I didn't mind.

We reserved a place in line through Yelp 60 minutes prior, and once we were at the restaurant, the hostess said that she'd seat us a few more parties later. We wandered around the nearby Rite Aid for a good half hour until we finally got a seat at the bar. We'd been hoping for a tabletop after such a long wait; the hostess did promise a table for us once one became available but apparently this never happened.We started out with some beer and wine; I got one of the daily beer specials and it was incredible. We then ordered some small plates - the sockeye salmon, the crab cakes, and the trout. The salmon was my favorite; it was so fresh and came with bread and a delightful mustard spread that paired perfectly. The crab cakes were a little more floury than I prefer, though they were so flavorful and had perfectly crispy edges. The salad that came with wasn't my favorite, the dressing was a weird combination of sweet and spicy. The trout was good, could use a bit more flavor but also crisped well. The tomato and mozzarella side and potato gnocchi that came with were absolutely incredible.My dad and I were still hungry so we ordered the fettuccine with clams after all this. Guys, we were completely blown out of the water. This is the dish you need to be ordering here! The entire pot was steaming and so fragrant. The clams were unbelievably fresh, there was garlic in every bite, quantity was generous. The pasta was somehow even better; it was so cheesy, to the point where you grab a forkful and cheese just oozes and pulls off your plate. I don't know if I've ever had such great pasta, it was that good. I will say that the dish was awfully heavy, so I'm glad that we did share rather than order individually. We left full and happy and very impressed with our experience! I do wish the seating / wait system was a little more organized but otherwise there are no complaints.

I wish we had one in CA!,-18.566666666666666,0.3978395061728394
129,2017-12-30,5.0,"Hands down my all time favorite seafood restaurant in all of Manhattan. You can't beat their happy hour with oysters and beer for us $12! The oysters are fresh and tastes amazing. They usually have 3-4 types of oysters to choose from even on happy hour. The clams fettuccine is butter, garlicky, and creamy. If you're going to have a cheat meal, the fettuccine is a must have!What I love most about this place tho are 2 things: hand selected craft beer and the service. They pick new beers on tap for each season. The summer time you will get watermelon beer and fall you will get pumpkin. When you drink a glass, you will know that it was hand selected with love and they know what customers would want to drink. It's like you can almost hear the owner say ""I love good craft beer and therefore my peeps shall have good beer!"" Lol!Lastly, the people who work here are incredibly attentive and nice. They know that I'm a regular so sometimes I get a nice treat. I would rather wait in line here for an hour than to go straight in at another seafood spot because it's that good!I mean, who would love you enough to feed you rum cake for free after dinner?!

132,2017-12-28,5.0,"Good drinks, great service, and even better food. I had a full-on 5 star experience at Upstate! (Thanks Shane!) The restaurant was smaller than I expected but we ended up getting seated at the bar, which was great because our bartender/server gave awesome recommendations and even ordered our oysters for us! Coming from the west coast, we wanted to try some east coast oysters and clams. They give you a slip and a pencil to mark down what you want and since my boyfriend and I were unfamiliar with the names, our server ordered for us and gave a description of every oyster. All were fresh, delicious, and a wonderful start to our meal. We also ordered the uni which came with bread, fish eggs, raw egg, and of course, uni. When mixed together, it created a flavor that I've never had before and it was absolutely decadent. The raw egg yolk overpowered the flavor of the uni a little but I still liked this dish a lot. For entrees, we opted for the fettuccine with clams and the scallop special with mushroom risotto. Trust me when I say this was the BEST fettuccine with clams I've ever had. I don't know what it was but the sauce they use for the pasta paired with the taste of salty clams made this A++, I'm drooling just thinking about it right now. If there is one thing on the menu that you should order if you come here it is the fettuccine!! The scallops on the risotto were HUGE and cooked to smooth perfection. In the middle of our meal, my boyfriend wanted to order a local beer and without hesitation, our server (pretty sure his name was Shane but if it's not, the very knowledgable and friendly one haha) put three champagne glasses in front of us with three different local beers. It was like a mini beer flight and he explained every one of them. At the end of our meal, he gave us whiskey bread with a beer pairing which was really, really good - and that's coming from someone who doesn't like beer or whiskey. Overall, it was an amazing first dinner in NYC. Quality service and food. 100% recommend and I'm definitely planning on coming back the next time I'm in NY!",-20.095833333333335,0.308948138755831

Attentive waitress who recommended a perfect wine and we just had a very enjoyable time. it was about a 30 minute wait on a Friday at 6:30pm - they do take your number so you can wait elsewhere. I had never had Uni (sea urchin) before but my friends ordered it and it was delicious. I was most excited about the fettuccine with clams but I was very very disappointed. Like other reviews said, it was, in fact, dry. On the other hand, I was pleasantly surprised by how good the scallops were, I believe served over a wild (?) rice risotto with mushrooms. We did also order some kind of seafood boil and tuna steak. I loved the tuna steak, normally I do love tuna steaks, the rest of my table wasn't impressed. The boil was a fan favorite with the scallops. We had a few apps and 4 entrees, 2 bottles of sauvignon blanc and I believe our entire meal for 4 came out to $200-$250, not only is this amazing for NYC (with wine) in general, but especially for seafood.",-20.095833333333335,0.29933333333333334

138,2017-12-17,3.0,"Finally made it here, two years after first adding it to my bookmarks list. Came around dinner time on a Friday night and the wait was about 30 minutes, so not so bad. After we were seated, I noticed that the atmosphere was very romantic, date night type with dim lighting and candles. It was cozy. I liked it.We had a very friendly waiter who explained the menu, including all the different types of oysters they offered. We had a little water spill accident and used our napkins to try to wipe things up but everything was still wet and then we dropped some utensils, being the clumsy people we are, but the waiters/waitresses were all very nice about getting us back in presentable shape. Up to this point, I would have given Upstate 4 stars, with potential for 5 depending on the food.We ordered the crab cakes, fettucine with clams, and the fish of the day. The crab cakes were pretty good. When I order crab cakes, I usually see if it's crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside, with not too much breading, but distinguishable pieces of lump crab meat. These were pretty close. The fettucine with clams was what I was looking forward to the most, but ended up being very disappointing. The fettucine was dry, the cheese not melted, and the clams did not taste that fresh. I'm a huge seafood lover so I'm pretty picky when it comes to seafood, and this did not meet my standards. The fish of the day was decent. The fish itself was a tad bit dry, but the sides of potato and brussel sprouts were seasoned nicely! I kind of liked the accompaniments more than the fish itself. Feeling pretty disappointed about the food, since this restaurant does have 4.5 stars with nearly 1500 reviews, I was going to go home and get dessert...but then they gave us two slices (although could have been bigger) of whiskey cake. These were really good and I wish we got more!Not a place I would come back to, but also don't regret checking it out.",-5.0440000000000005,0.12333333333333334
139,2017-12-17,5.0,"Seafood lovers, Upstate is where you can eat to your heart's and belly's content and then some!Where to start? Everything was SO good. Clams and Fettuccine: Until now, I never found the appeal of clams and never went out of my way to seek them out. BUT I could eat two bowls of this dish. I think the pasta must have been cooked in clam juice, as it had that subtle scent of the sea with just the right amount of saltiness. The sauce tasted like various types of cheeses + tons of garlic, which can only mean a party for my taste buds. Gosh, I am salivating just thinking about this dish. The oysters + beer special: 6 oysters + beer are $12 ($16 with wine) and happy hour lasts from 5-7 every single day. How great is that? The specials they had on oysters were only the briny ones, but I still found them quite flavorful even though I normally gravitate toward the sweet ones. I ended up getting two orders of this. Crab cakes: I believe this is the best deal on crab cakes you can get in the city! The crab meat is bountiful and seared just perfectly on each side for that beautiful crust. It tasted buttery and delicious. Ok - I need to stop reviewing now, as I am getting really hungry again.I'll be back many times over to order the same dishes!

141,2017-12-12,2.0,"I have had Upstate bookmarked on my Yelp for a hot minute now and I finally had the chance to try it with my cousin and her friend when we were (somewhat) in the area doing a low-key Speakeasy tour (Death & Co, PDT, Angels' Share, etc). It's rare that I'm THIS disappointed with a place with the number of rave reviews that it has. I know I didn't order incorrectly, either, because I had the pasta with clams, which seems to be the go-to dish. My cousin's friend had the same, and my cousin ordered the scallops. Now, I will give Upstate credit where credit is due - it is particularly inexpensive for seafood in Manhattan. With that being acknowledged, I feel like I've said everything positive I needed to say. I found the pasta to be bland and uninspired and the clams were incredibly chewy and somewhat room temperature as well. My cousin's friend felt exactly the same way, and my cousin was not blown away by her scallops. The food was easily a 3/5 - not atrocious, but I wouldn't even go so far as to call it good. I'm taking away an extra star because despite the restaurant being super slow (I think it was a Sunday or something so there weren't a ton of people in there) the service was even slower. We timed it and it took close to an hour from the time we ordered for our pasta to come out. I almost never ask the server about the food because I used to work in restaurants and know that a lot of the time it's nobody's fault...but come on, an hour is really, really bad. I should be able to order a pork chop well done and not have it take that long. The restaurant is your typical bumf*ck East Village hole in the wall - pretty narrow and cramped, nothing exceptional. The beer selection isn't anything special. The complimentary pound cake at the end of our meal was a nice touch but, like the pasta, just wasn't good. It tasted like cheap grocery store pound cake. I wanted to go out to dinner not to my grandma's nursing home potluck. TL;DR - had to try it eventually, disappointed I did. Will not return",0.1818181818181817,0.12351764397218944

The first time, I ordered the tartare and the second time I went for happy hour and ordered some oysters (all east coast) and the cioppino.  Having just visited San Francisco, I am all about cioppino. I expected a rich flavorful broth with a mix of delights from the sea. What I received was a bowl of tiny mussels with a clam, bland fish pieces and a prawn head. While I appreciate the effort they place on letting the seafood speak for itself, cioppino is traditionally well seasoned. I do see why this is a favorite in a city like NYC though. The pricing is very attractive and the food is fresh. My cioppino was filling and priced at $18. Nothing on the menu is above $18 and all the food is seafood. I may come back one day but I would never wait more then 10 min for a table. Especially since there are other wonderful restaurants nearby.",6.325,0.23253968253968252

The restaurant is relatively small so popular weekend dinner times can definitely have a wait. My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday evening and were seated immediately at the bar. I liked it because you get a view of their kitchen and the bartender is very friendly. Squid Salad - A crap load of soft, tender squid over sautéed kale and drizzle of honey. The squid was beautifully grilled with the yummy grilled taste to it.Crab Cake - two crisp on the outside, soft on the inside crab cakes with a great crab ratio. Very tasty. It laid over a bed of corn and greens with a sweet sauce. I am not a fan of sweet with savory but regardless of my personal preference, it was still a great dish! Scallops over mushroom risotto - This dish was very evidently popular amongst the patrons and it definitely deserves that kind of popularity. The dish was clean, simple yet was packed with flavor from the mushroom. Risotto was well-cooked, not soggy but had a good chew to it. The scallops were cooked perfectly, soft to the bite. Complimentary whiskey cake - don't miss out on this. Satisfies the sweet tooth at the end. It had a good hint of whiskey, tasting almost like a butterscotch pound cake. Yum!Overall, a great fresh meal! We were nicely full after these plates.  I am definitely interested in coming back and trying more of their dishes, including the fettuccine with clams.

We usually never pay full price for oysters since there are so many excellent happy hours in the city, but their extensive list was so appealing that we ordered three varieties each.  All of them were excellent - specifically the ones from Virginia and New Zealand.  To start, we had the uni appetizer which was good but I don't think either of us were huge fans of the texture of the uni mixed with salmon roe and egg yolk.  I would have much rather used the uni as a spreadable paste for the toasts!  We then shared the fettuccine with clams and the scallops over mushroom risotto.

Omg just thinking about it makes me want it again. The risotto pasta was perfectly textured - not too soggy like it's like mushy oatmeal but not too hard. It was perfectly textured, and the flavor was so mushroomy!! I expected little chopped up mushrooms but there were actually whole delicious juicy mushrooms in the risotto.

The servers and bartenders (BTW, I recommend sitting at the bar, at least once) will walk you through.  In addition to their main fare, I HIGHLY recommend the Idaho Trout.  My friend and I got 4 orders once.  Perhaps we were lacking in specific freshwater fish nutrients, but that's besides the point - it's just amazing.  Finally, their beer and wine selection offers the perfect pairing(s) for whatever you choose to consume.

What's great is that you can choose the type of oysters you like or try them all. I know other oyster places only serve ""an oyster of the day special."" It's really cool to have the opportunity to compare different types of oysters since there's factors of texture, taste, and how grainy it could be.

202,2017-08-04,3.0,"I'd give this place a 3.5 stars - the service is great once you are seated, but the seating seemed really arbitrary at the door and the food left more to be desired. My issue with the seating was that I was made to wait because my friend had not arrived - yet another patron was already seated at a table before I arrived and was apparently waiting for his girlfriend who arrived maybe 5 minutes before my friend. Perhaps I should have just told them I was a party of one and asked for a table for one while waiting for my friend? Oh, they also ended up giving the table that opened up for us to that guy and his girlfriend and giving us the table they didn't want. Otherwise, the happy hour deal here is difficult to beat. $12 for a beer + 6 oysters (limited to 3 choices that they will point out to you), and a $4 surcharge if you want wine instead of beer. Pretty awesome. My friend and I both went with white wines that we thought would go well with the shellfish we were planning on ordering and we were right.We ordered all of the oysters that they included in the happy hour deal and the mussels - which my friend said was what they were known for. While I really enjoyed the oysters, the mussels were a tad too fishy for my taste. I think I prefer my mussels prepared Flex Mussels style, but I'm not a mussel connoisseur, so perhaps I just can't appreciate the fishiness of mussels that aren't drenched in sauce. Personally, I would have preferred a thicker, stronger tasting broth than what their mussels were cooked in.  Beyond my issue with the seating, the service here is great. We barely waited 5-10 minutes for our check, but our waitress was super apologetic and even brought us a little extra bit of wine to compensate us for our wait. They also provided two complimentary slices of pound cake for dessert just because they did not have a dessert menu and thought we could use something sweet to follow our meal.

I went here for dinner with my parents and we caught the tail end of their happy hour rush and were told there would be about an hour wait. No problem - I downloaded whichever app they use to monitor their line and we went to a nearby bar for drinks. When the app showed there were two parties ahead of us we returned and the hostess seemed genuinely shocked we were back. We waited and she said there would be a table cleared soon so she sat the three of us at two bar stools. I let my parents sit while I awkwardly hovered in the very narrow space. We ordered some crab cakes and beers to pass the time - thankfully after about 15 minutes a solo diner at the bar finished up and I could grab his seat. There was no table opening up anytime soon. BUT. That didn't matter because sitting at the bar we had a great time talking to the owner. He let us try different beers, kept pouring us extra tastes and was just very pleasant to talk to. I can't remember everything we drank that night but I could tell this was a beer menu he had put thought into. I don't think anyone in my party had a bad beer. Once we were settled in we got the squid salad, my dad got the swordfish steak, my mom got the beer steamed mussels and I got the scallop special. It was all very delicious - especially the squid salad. It was so simple but the squid was perfectly charred. Overall we had a great time - just getting to it proved to be a hassle.

Our server Shane was absolutely AMAZING. He was so sweet and explained the menu and happy hour throughly... and you don't get that very often in NYC. He gave great suggestion, knew the menu very well, and checked on us every 5/10 minutes. He was definitely one of the best servers we both have ever had! We ordered the octopus salad to start which was super refreshing and light and had really great flavors.We also ordered the clam fettuccine and the wild beer mussels. The fettuccine was absolutely amazing FULL of flavor and cheesy... sooo gooood!!! ... I'll definitely be back for an order! We weren't a huge a fan of the mussels they were really big and the broth didn't have much flavor but we added the scotch bonnet pepper sauce Shane suggested to it and it gave it a kick! I'll definitely be back for wine and mussels during their happy hour and to try the other gems on the menu! So happy we found a cute spot in the neighborhood!",18.40666666666667,0.34816911139455786
212,2017-07-16,3.0,"3.5 stars. Got here at 8 pm on a Friday with a party of 4, and we were told the wait would be 1.5 hours. Ended up only being one hour, so that was a pleasant surprise. Our waitress was super friendly and helpful in describing all the different types of oysters. We got 4 different types, and some were delicious, some were not. Tip - the bigger the oyster, the less flavorful they are! The food was ok - the sea urchin dish was quite strange - it had a weird licorice taste that I was not used to. The fettuccine with clams was good but suuuper garlicky - I love garlic, but it was even too much for me. The cioppino was fantastic - the best dish we had that night. Overall, we did not think this restaurant lived up to its hype - I've had delicious oysters elsewhere in NYC without needing to wait an hour. If there's ever no line, I would go back only for the cioppino.",18.40666666666667,0.2849206349206349
213,2017-07-14,3.0,"3.5 really, but I think that it's just because this place was hyped too much and I was a bit disappointed. Got in around 7pm without a wait--surprisingly. We ordered the uni/egg/salmon roe appetizer and the grilled squid salad. Both were just okay. Even though I love uni and salmon roe, somehow the addition of the egg and carrot puree took away from it overall. Maybe I'm used to Japanese restaurants where each individual ingredient is given a chance to shine, but for some reason the combination of all the ingredients together (especially if you mix it all up like the restaurant recommends) detracted from the individual parts. Too bad.The squid salad was interesting but also not amazing. The squid was well grilled, but the smokiness was almost too much considering how small the pieces were. Also the honey was interesting and balanced out the bitter kale but...again, it just didn't quite come together for me. The best dish of the night was the cioppino  (I'm butchering the spelling, but basically the seafood in a tomato broth). The seafood was large and scrumptious and the tomato broth was seafoody and oh so good to dip bread in!I think what I realized is that I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to seafood. If the quality of the ingredients is good there's no need to add all of these random flavors that overpower those of the seafood itself. Since I live nearby I'm willing to give this place another go--next time I think I'll stick to things that focus more on the seafood or adds only one extra flavor (like tomato). Tl;dr: if you get in without a line try something that focuses more on the seafood and less on random other ingredients. If there's an hour wait....I'd go somewhere else.",18.40666666666667,0.13029942279942278

216,2017-07-07,4.0,"Good food, slightly more on the expensive end, but it is quite a popular place. It is a very small space and we waited about 45 minutes. Luckily there is a (very) not crowded restaurant/bar next door, so we sat there for a drink prior (and probably saved a few bucks). Oyster happy hour is standard price and the oysters seemed fresh. I'm not an oyster connoisseur. This is a place I would definitely go with a friend who may be visiting NYC, but I would limit it to once on my own - and limit it to up to 2-3 people per visit.",18.40666666666667,0.20055555555555554
217,2017-07-05,5.0,"This is one of the best restaurants in NYC.Now, a lot of restaurants fail for a lot of different reasons. Sometimes the problem is simple math (a business plan that can't work), sometimes the problem is an identity crisis, and sometimes the problem is execution.With regard to Upstate, I can't speak to the first problem because they don't show their books to strangers (weird, I know). But there are no problems with the latter two issues. Upstate knows exactly what it is, and they KILL IT when it comes to execution.This is a seafood and beer establishment, and they offer the freshest and most delicious in both categories (at reasonable prices), as well as friendly, impeccable service. I absolutely love this place, and you will too.Shane, the man behind this fine establishment, is from Utica. Don't hold that against him though, because he's the man. He will most likely be behind the bar, pouring you tastes of beers you'll love, and talking up the fish he got up obscenely early to procure so you could have a tasty meal. Be grateful. When you sit down, order some oysters. Order some specials. Order off the menu. Get the tuna tartare, or the marlin crudo that was caught that morning. Get the mako special. Definitely get the fettuccine with clams. Wash it all down with whatever beer or wine appeals to you, and you'll probably finish the meal very satisfied, kind of drunk, and with a delicious slice of whiskey pound cake on the house. If that doesn't sound good to you, your life makes me sad.",18.40666666666667,0.21680307539682536
218,2017-07-05,5.0,"Fantastic. I've wanted to come here for about a year but was worried about the line we'd have to wait in. We arrived around 5:30 and were told we'd have to wait 40 minutes, but a spot opened up within ten minutes. The happy hour deal is $12 for 6 oysters and a beer, or $16 for 6 oysters and wine - not bad at all. The oysters were super fresh and swimming in salt water. Out of the three types of happy hour oysters, our favorite was the second one listed (don't remember the name though.) Plus, the bartender was very friendly and offered us a sample of the stout when my boyfriend couldn't decide on a beer.Highlight of the night was definitely the diver scallops on brown rice mushroom risotto. Melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. Usually my problem with risotto is that it's too rich, but this one was a perfect, light umami flavor - and the brown rice helped with the meal not feeling too heavy.Upstate is a small place but that's what makes it feel so alive. Sitting near the kitchen, you realize that to run a place like this, you may not need a lot of space, but you need to keep moving. Watching the cooks sear soft shell crabs in one moment, then chuck them in the oven the next, was inspirational and reminiscent of the dynamic spirit of the city.",18.40666666666667,0.2628623188405797

The space itself is trendy and neat, but pretty small so it was already packed by the time we showed up. The hostess said it was going to be about a 40 minute wait and suggested going to one of the many bars next door for a drink until our table was ready. She recommended an AWESOME bar next door, and when our table was ready, they texted us so it was a pretty big win win. After we got seated, we immediately dived into the menu. We ordered their happy hour oysters, the smoked salmon, and an order of the mussels. Food came out pretty quickly, and everything tasted so fresh and delicious. Man oh man, I can't get over how good everything was. The mussels, in particular, were HUGE which only made us happier. For two people, this amount of food was PERFECT,  and we left feeling satisfied. Since we came during happy hour, our bill was pretty damn reasonable especially considering the food that we got. Even if it wasn't happy hour, I'd still happily come here since the food and service were so spot on. Can't wait to come back here.",18.40666666666667,0.42142857142857143
221,2017-06-28,3.0,When I was a boy I would spend summers in a small fishing villa on the north coast of Portugal. It was a sleepy town of old men and their women. There were a dozen cafes and only one church. The fishermen would rise early to fish and then return with the fish to sell just as the town was waking. I recall the women in their head scarves and the men already in their cups of vinho verde and other things crying out peixes to me as I passed by. There were sardines and grouper and others I didn't recognize. An octopus in a pot of cold water stuck out a tentacle only to have it smacked back by a ready wooden spoon. My uncle would take me walking along the beach looking for razor clams and mussels and when we would find them he tore them from the rock and opened them up and ate them live. He died a handful of winters back. Those were simple times. Whenever I eat mussels I remember those times and my uncle and his sunburned face and shoulders and the taste of raw mussels and the salt spray and sand and cold water of the Northern Portuguese Coast. The mussels at Upstate are much larger than the ones from back then. One was gritty but the rest were fine. There was one shrimp in the dish I ate. Only one. The wine was good and there was a lot of it and so were the crab cakes though they were few and small for the price. Not like the mussels. Three stars.,18.40666666666667,-0.033447455322455306

Food does take a while to come though but the wait is definitely worth it because the food was delicious. I got the scallops with mushroom risotto and it was amazing. The scallops were perfectly seared and one of the best I've had. The risotto had a nice texture and paired perfectly with the mushrooms. Flavor was on point and not too salty. I also got to try some of my friend's fettuccine with clams and that was delightful as well. The clams come with big pieces of meat and the fettuccine was cooked a perfect al dente and flavored nicely with olive oil and cheese. After our meal we got complimentary whisky cake. Very tasty and you can definitely taste the alcohol. The entrees here are about $20 each but I definitely think it's worth it.

This is the perfect place for a nice dinner with your significant other or a few friends.  It gets a little tight on the weekends of course.  What trendy restaurant like this isn't!  The food here is delicious.  I mean it's definitely above average and very simple. Nothing to crazy, very crisp and clean flavors.  For appetizers, the civiche and the Uni were just okay. I do recommend the fresh oysters!  Having lived in the Pacific Northwest and husking oysters on farms, I can vouch to say their oysters are definitely fresh and on point.  Not bad but definitely not 5 star quality.  The fettuccini clam was the hit for entrees.  It is rich and creamy with a generous amount of clams inside and perfectly cooked tender noodles.  The mussels were also very delicious and not over steamed.  The service here is great. Our waiter was very attentive.Cons: the space is very tight, watch where you are walking.

It's dim and cozy, there.Food:  Okay, let me just say that the food just plain rocks!  The oysters were great, they do a nice job of offering great selections from both coasts.  Fresh tasting and shucked nicely where you won't get amateurish bits of shells left in the meat.   My buddies tried the crab cake apps and they were top notch.   For dinner, I had the monk fish special, it was phenomenal.  Flavorful and nicely accompanied by well seasoned vegetables.  To me the portions were a teeny, tiny bit smaller than what I'd like... Either because I was so hungry or maybe I'm just a pig, maybe both.  My buddy had the mako special which was great as well.Service:  Top notch!  We had a small group of three where no table was available, but we lucked out and got three seats a the bar next to the kitchen.  The guys working there were super helpful with the menu items and the craft beer tastings.  We got our food/drinks quickly and efficiently.  Thumbs up to those guys!Prices:  Surprisingly reasonable.  $2.75+ oysters, $12~$14 apps, $18 ish main dishes.  Not bad at all.  Our check came out huge, mostly due to us drinking like a fish plus the dozens of oysters we've ordered.  Man, do we indulge...

We ordered the cured salmon appetizer, beer steamed mussels and fettuccine with clams. We had high expectations about this place based on the good reviews, but sadly, we were let down. Cured salmon appetizer: very salty. We had to ask for fresh lemons to wash away the saltiness. Maybe we are just not used to the cured salmon but it was an okay dish. Wouldn't order t again. Beer steamed mussels: this dish compared to the appetizer is actually very flavorless. I can't taste much from this dish. They under seasoned the mussels. It was okay, not great. Fettuccine with clams: this is actually a salty dish compared to the mussels. Very salty to be honest. The clams was seasoned great, but the fettuccine was over seasoned, a lot. Service was pretty decent, asked how we were doing about 2 times. The seat I sat in was next to the bar, so the waiters bumped into my seat a lot even though I sat super close to the table. So if you can, avoid that seat. They also give out complementary whiskey pound cake as desserts. One thin slice per guest. You can literally taste the whiskey in the cake, it was a bit too strong for us. Overall, I would return back to try the oysters, scallop mushroom risotto and the soft shell crab.

We walked in the restaurant without feeling too hungry, but we devoured it! Great plate to share. The salmon was a bit salty but it went well with the bread and this sauce they had on the plate. My girlfriend added lemon on the salmon, which made it better. As for main dish, I had the fettuccine with clams. The clams were so fresh and plump! It was very good. The fettuccine was okay, it went well with the clams but super oily. My girlfriend had the beer steamed mussels, and YES you can actually taste the beer in the mussels.  After we were done, the restaurant provide a slice of whiskey pound cake per person and ... it was quite interesting. I actually ate the part that was soaked in whiskey, it has a very strong taste.
