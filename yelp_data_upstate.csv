0,2018-11-25,4.0,"Great service, food was good but not as amazing as I had expected considering the reviews?I ordered the lamb as my entree and it was extremely fatty. The portion is quite big but a lot of it I was picking off the fatty parts. There are veggies that come with this plate, but there isn't much.The ravioli is good, we had that as an app. It's a little confusing because the pastas are right next to the app portion of the menu, so I'm assuming those are app portions? The ravioli comes in 6 pieces. Bread is slightly stale, don't really recommend eating it to fill you up before your meal.We also tried the steak frites that came with this au poivre sauce I believe? The sauce was too floral in terms of taste. The fries were slightly soggy, I would've preferred for it to be more crispy. For dessert, we had the crepes. These crepes are doused in this sweet cream sauce. It was good, not amazing. Beautiful restaurant, with indoor and outdoor seating. Res was quite easy to make on a weekend night. It does get busy in there. There is bar seating as well. Huge space. The burger looks good. They have a green hour (their version of HH) where they have a burger for $12. Would come back to try that. Maybe the lamb I got that day was just bad. I'd be willing to give this place another shot.",18.40666666666667,0.16838860544217685

2,2018-11-18,5.0,Beautiful setting. Beautiful view. Food is delicious.  The price is a bit high compare to other places. But it is worth it if you are looking for a beautiful place to enjoy brunch with friends.,18.40666666666667,0.535625
3,2018-11-17,5.0,"I was invited to come back to give Boucherie another chance and I'm glad I decided to accept the offer. It felt like a completely different dining experience and I'm excited to have a French restaurant that serves delicious food close to where we live.We were greeted promptly by our delightful server who was attentive without being overbearing. The other people in the service staff were also wonderful, our water glasses were never empty and when we were finished eating the various courses our dirty dishes were promptly cleared.Our server recommended a few glasses of wine that were full bodied and complemented our dishes perfectly.For food, we decided to be adventurous and ordered the frog legs per the suggestion of our server, and wow they were delicious. The plate comes out sizzling hot and the frog legs themselves are perfectly seasoned and I tasted a touch of lemon that made me think of a calamari dish.I also had enjoyed the foie gras the first time I came so we decided to re order that, and it was just as good as I remembered - perfectly smooth with a delicious onion compote to complement the flavors.  Unfortunately they did not have gluten free bread for my fiancé but the brioche bread that comes with the foie gras that I was able to enjoy is great.For the main, our server suggested we share the porterhouse for 2.  The steak was prepared to a perfect medium rare throughout - only the very tips/ends were a little more medium.  There was a nice amount of flavoring without being overwhelming and barely any fat on either side.  I personally am more of a filet person so enjoyed that more than the strip, though both were delicious. The bearnaise sauce that comes on the side offers a nice extra flavor profile to complement the steak. We also ordered the potato gratin and cream spinach. The potatoes had a nice crispy outer layer  with a softer interior and the spinach was awesome, the seasoning and flavors were amazing and even though it probably was, it didn't feel unhealthy like most cream spinaches do.For dessert, the gluten free options were creme brûlée and chocolate mousse. We opted for the mousse and it was light but offered just the right amount of sweetness to finish off a great meal.Overall, boucherie exceeded my expectations the second time around and I will definitely be coming back!",18.40666666666667,0.3450841543513957

6,2018-11-14,4.0,"Located in West Village, Boucherie restaurant had great ambience, diverse drinks options and variety of French cuisine.We ordered Escargot, Foie Gras and Steak tartare as appetizers.All of them were fresh and tasty. We really enjoyed each appetizer. For entrees, we got Porterhouse and Lobster. Though steak was cooked medium rare, there were some dry, burnt portions at the ends. I would try different steak entree next time.Lobster, however, was cooked perfectly. Presentation of the food was elegant too! Lastly, dessert was unique and delicious.",18.40666666666667,0.37179487179487186
7,2018-11-13,2.0,"While the food at Boucherie is good, I would never recommend it for more that a small party.  We'd been working with their manager for almost two months for a party of 20, and when we arrived the table was set for less than 18.  Instead of making more room in the restaurant - which was almost empty outside of our party - they instead sat two of our family at a completely separate table.  When we asked to incorporate the two, the manager seemed far more interested in being right, insisting we had only said 18 despite the fact that we had an email confirmation for 20 people.  My mother - one of the sweetest people - almost got into a yelling match with the manager.This is the part where I should mention this late lunch was actually my wedding reception post-city hall.  It wasn't great to watch someone argue with my mom instead of adding two seats to the table.In the end they did make attempts to correct the situation, but watching the manager at a restaurant where the party planned to drop several thousand dollars yell at the customer instead of make VERY simple changes left a tarnish on my wedding day.Wait staff tried their best, and the food came out very quickly, but management needs some lessons in customer service.",18.40666666666667,0.20725623582766442
8,2018-11-13,3.0,"Excellent food, good service, questionable management. Wedding party of 20. After confirming reservation the day before, the table was set up for less than this. One couple ended up being seated separately and it took an act of Congress with the argumentative manager to get two more chairs at the table and given the place was only partially filled, this was ridiculous. Same couple was skipped when meals were ordered, but wait staff and excellent kitchen staff got right on it while manager aloofly texted. Wait staff did an overall good job, kitchen staff and quality of food were terrific. Recommend for smaller parties, but not for larger groups based on this experience.",18.40666666666667,0.22410714285714284

10,2018-11-10,4.0,"Perfect place for dinner near NYU and Washington Arc. Authentic french cuisine with a nice bar. Several large groups on site at that night. Though the food was a little bit pricey, it was worth it. The service was good offered by knowledgeable waitors and the manager.

12,2018-11-09,5.0,"Came here late on a Friday night with a friend who was in from out of town and had a seat at the bar. Was greeted at the door by the hostess who was very cordial. Didn't eat, so can't comment on the food, but they have an extensive cocktail menu of absinthe drinks. Each one was super unique and the bartender was friendly and patient in explaining each drink and making recommendations. Each drink was quite strong, but also quite tasty. Manager was also super friendly and came over to check on us and engaged us in conversation for a few minutes despite it being busy. Overall our experience here was a pleasure. I only regret I didn't get to taste the food - will be back to do that!",18.40666666666667,0.14464285714285713

14,2018-11-08,5.0,"Writing an update to my previous review.  To be completely honest, I made a huge mistake. The review that I left was actually for a different restaurant, and while I thought I was at Boucherie, I wasn't.  The entire story is a long one and I won't bore you with the details.  After my original review, Zorica (GM) reached out to me and said that the service that I was given was not at all typical and up to their standards and she wanted to make it right, by giving them a chance to make it up to me.  Zorica was amazing in offering me an great incentive to come back and try again, along with handling a special request that they don't normally do.I went their last night, and as soon as I was sat at my table (which was probably the best table in the place) I realized the mistake I made.  I reached out to the current manager and informed him of my mistake, apologized and I stated that I did not deserve all that Zorica was doing for me.  He said not to worry about it at all.  Now to the actual review.  Long story short, the entire experience was top shelf.  The wine and appetizers (Foie Gras, Mussles and Escargots) were incredible.  For the main course we split the Chateabriand, and it was probably the best steak experience I've had in NY.  Seasoned perfectly and the most tender piece of meat I've eaten in a while, and the peppercorn sauces were heavenly.  I still can't believe I made such a mistake in my original review and hopefully they can forgive me for that.  I will be sure to return with friends as often as I can.",18.40666666666667,0.28261183261183265
15,2018-11-07,5.0,"""Boucherie"" means ""butchery"" in French, so my biggest tip for this place is GET A STEAK. Any of them. My biggest regret was getting only one steak dish instead of two. Girlfriend and I split the filet mignon with truffle butter and the Pot A Feu (Sunday special, short ribs, oxtail with veggies and broth). The steak was phenomenal. I wanted to order medium-rare, but girlfriend wanted medium.  However you want your meat cooked, they will do it perfectly. Even though it was medium, it was the most tender, juicy steak I've ever had in my life. Damn perfect.The Pot A Feu was very nice. It was subtle and delicate, and I am glad I was able to try it. I probably wouldn't order it again, though. It was hard going from the truffle butter filet mignon, that curb stomped your taste buds, to a really light, subtly flavored broth. We still finished the hell out of the Pot A Feu until there was only bones left.Every appetizer on the menu sounded so good. We settled on the asparagus salad and the escargot. I loved every bite of the salad, which came with a poached although I wish it had just a little more asparagus. Another piece or 2 would have been perfect. I haven't had too many escargots before, but Boucherie's was easily the best I've had. We were so full at the end, but we still got a creme brulee. I loved it.I highly recommend the Boucherie Old Fashioned. It was one of the best cocktails I've ever had. Final scores: 420/69 for the wait staff and bar tenders. 710/420 for the food.",18.40666666666667,0.3411547619047619
16,2018-11-06,5.0,Perfect date night / post- workday dinner spot. Lively atmosphere in a huge space - I would recommend making reservations because it fills up quickly around 6:30pm.

18,2018-11-04,4.0,"Ended up at Boucherie unexpectedly after a change in plans for dinner at another restaurant in the area and but had a solid dinner. I will say that when we arrived, with a reservation, as a party of four black people in a restaurant that was full of predominantly white patrons and escorted through the entire restaurant, up the stairs, and then seated at a table in the tiny wine room I was completely put off. While the restaurant was busy, there were tables open that could seat four downstairs on the main floor. One our host even awkwardly stopped at making us believe it was our table before she continued on through the restaurant up a set of stairs, to the end of that dining room and finally to our seat. Again off putting and I do think problematic. However, our waiter was wonderful and his service was attentive.The food was great, well portioned and nicely presented. All what I would expect from a solid four star restaurant in the West Village. Our waiter recommended for drinks that I try the Amelie. It was light and sweet, not too boozy. For my meal, I had the beet salad which was light, came with a good amount of beets and smear of goat cheese. Nice way to start. For my entree, I had the bronzino which came de-boned, etc as two fillets. This was topped with a chunky tomato and artichoke jus. Plenty of fish but not too much-- a good portion size. We finished with a creme brûlée that was tasty but not out of the ordinary. A restaurant for a solidly good meal, but nothing to extraordinary. We might be back.",18.40666666666667,0.23641975308641974
19,2018-11-04,5.0,"We had a 7pm res for a party of 11 for a Birthday  dinner on a Saturday.  We had a terrific experience.  Wonderful, attentive service by everyone including the front of the house.  It was busy but they had a large table in the back for us with plenty of space.  Place was large but oddly not noisy which is great.  Food was excellent - the steaks were cooked wonderfully. Typical French bistro fare.  Four of us in our party ordered the ""Butcher's Block"" which is a huge cutting board with four cuts of meat (ribeye, hanger steak, NY strip, and filet).  It was $205 which I think is a great deal.   It easily could have served five ppl.  Each steak was different in texture and taste and it was great to sample each cut.  Each of us preferred a different cut for a different reason though the filet was a standout.  Four different sauces accompanied it.  The front space did look a little tight with tables close together.   Beautiful bar.   Lots of cocktails made expertly.  An unusually long list of absinthe drinks.  Recommended.",18.40666666666667,0.2365
20,2018-11-02,5.0,"An amazing experience at a casual French Restaurant . Sign me up for more. I went here for a guy's night two-weeks back. I haven't had to much experience with French cuisine in the past, but I must say Boucherie went above and beyond. One thing that has been so lacking for me of late, in my NYC dining experiences... has been good service. And the service at Boucherie was EXCELLENT. From the moment we met the hostess, being seated, and being checked on. Well done.Another big surprise was the quality of the cocktail drinks. The Old Fashioned was made like a champion, and all of my friends loved their mixed libations as well. Let's talk food, my favorite part:1) Steak Tartare- I've had this appetizer before and it was really tasty combined with the capers.2)Mousse de Foie Gras- The Goose liver was rich in flavor, although not my favorite thing to order in most places. 3) The Pan Seared Tuna Ahi- One of the better salad appetizer's I've trie in a while.4) Escargot- I'd never tried this before.. and ill be honest I didn't really like it, but my friend said it was on point.. to each their own ?5) Main Course- Rack of Lamb- This was spot on one of the best meals I've had in quite some time.. I ordered it Medium and it was juicy, succulent and cooked to perfection.  I highly highly recommend you order this when you visit.6) Dessert- Cream Brulet and Chocolate Mousse- We split this as a group, the chocolate was rich and this was a surprisingly good desert.The meal at Boucherie was full of surprises from start to finish. But overall, if someone was looking for a fancy meal, without the typical snobby attitude of a high-end place.. Look no further ! It's not a cheap night, but well worth it.",18.40666666666667,0.24081081081081085
21,2018-11-02,4.0,"I had two friends visiting from out of town, and we wanted to do a special occasion group dinner. French cuisine was proposed...so we ended up at Boucherie, which impressed just as much as expected.The dinner atmosphere and decor was fantastic -- warm, intimate, classy, upscale, beautiful. The service was great for our table as well.Be prepared to splurge, since this place is definintely not cheap. Maybe save it for a special date or celebration. We ordered a round of champagne, which tasted perfect. Then we got the escargot to start, which was probably my favorite dish -- excellently done, and don't forget to dip the complimentary bread in the leftover butter/juice/sauce. Thinking about it now is making me salivate...Then, per our waiter's recommendation, we all ordered either a meat or fish dish: two brazinos, one lamb chop, one steak, and one duck confit. Everything was beautifully plated (especially the lamb) and, I think, well-liked around the table. I can only speak to the duck confit specifically, but it was delicious and solidly portioned. Of course, we then couldn't leave without getting some desserts to share. My favorite was definitely the profiteroles -- highly recommend. The other two (pistachio bombe glacee and mousse au chocolat) were good but forgettable.All in all, great dining experience. Even though the meal ended up being supremely expensive (part of that was on us and how we ordered though...), the food, ambience, and mood were worth it for the special celebration.",18.40666666666667,0.3647235023041475
22,2018-11-01,4.0,"We stumbled into this place after attempting to survive the stampede of the Halloween day parade. The manager and hostess were very friendly and accommodating. The prices are on a higher end, but you do get very well prepared food. For the appetizer we ordered escargot, mussels, and frog legs. The mussels were especially exceptional with mushrooms and thick bacon. I must say that the escargot was much larger in size and quantity than usual. For entrees we got the seafood squid ink linguini, duck confit, steak frites, and organic chicken dish. The steak was spiced very well, but it was tad bit overcooked. They gave us an extra escargot dish because we waited for a long time. We didn't ask for it or complained, but it was a nice touch. The drinks were interesting, but one of the drinks tasted like a perfume in an unpleasant way. The waiter was friendly, but he was rushed due to the quantity of people and what appeared to be short staffing. He was also slightly ill informed about the detailed of the food. He didn't know the amount of frog legs in the apetizer and told us it's two frog legs in a dish, and we ordered two sets. He was concerned egnouth to find out that 6 legs come in the dish, and we canceled one order. The dessert was out of this world. We had some sort of pistachio icecream that gets dark chocolate poured over it tableside. Profiteroles with icecream were amazing as well. So my only complaints were flagging the waiter and hunting him down due to short staffing, and long wait for food. I felt like considering the large size of the restaurant they can expect a large amount of people at any given time, and that should be reflected in the amount of people in the kitchen and amount of waiters. However, the food was excellent and I highly recomend it if your in the area. Price wise, it's the city so nothing to complain about.",18.40666666666667,0.10289442039442041

24,2018-10-30,5.0,"This location is better than Boucherie Park due to its more intimate and homey vibe. You can enjoy a nice meal with friends or with a significant other without feeling rushed or being too close to a neighboring table. The staff is also really attentive and comes by ever so often to check up on you so it's a great place for a date with minimal interruption.Franco Mexican War -  a neat drink that had a bit of a smokey kick to it. Perfect for someone looking for something light but not sweet/fruity.Steak Tartare - Even if you're not a fan of raw meat, you should give this dish a try. It's one of their signature dishes and it's packed full of flavor! The quail egg was a nice touch as you can drop the egg into the dish before mixing it in! Salade Nicoise - This app was big enough for two people to share and is a good alternative for the healthy eaters out there. I didn't get a chance to try it in Nice, France and was delighted to see it on the menu.Faux-Filet Bercy - This dish was better than the Tomahawk in my opinion. The steak was cooked perfectly. The outside had a bit of a crisp while the inside maintained a juicy yet tender medium rare center. No need for any sauce as it was good on its own!Profiteroles - The best part of the meal! It's a fun dessert to share due to its construction/texture. The chocolate covered cream puffs were soft. The ice cream along with the chocolate syrup was slightly melted so you could dig right in! No need to wait! Presentation of the dish was on par, and I highly recommend it!",18.40666666666667,0.3428781803781804

29,2018-10-25,5.0,"You know I can say that I have never eaten at a french restaurant before.My impressions were that it was all duck entrees or funky euro-salads. And of course that ""snail"" dish. But after eating here all I can say is:Donnez-moi plus s'il vous plaît! (thank you google translate).I came in for an early dinner with my brother and two friends. The large and beautiful architecture inside made a casual dining space seem more elegant.Right off the bat the waiters were pouring us water and giving us drink menus to peruse. Call me old-fashioned, but I went with the Boucherie Old Fashioned (my puns rock!) and was not disappointed. Lets get onto the good stuff - the food. Here's where the Boucherie immediately won me over. Our group ordered four different appetizers all that were delicious.The Steak Tartare was mixed very well and put together with the shallots and capers was a table favorite. The Mousse de Foie Gras was a very rich liver of goose that really surprised me with its taste. The large piece we got was quickly scooped off the plate by my fellow table-mates.Who can forget the Salad! The Salade Nicoise had we seasoned and served pan seared tuna ahi tuna on the top that fulfilled the sea-food quota for the night.Onto the Escargots.. I admit I actually wanted to pass on this. But my friend Gennady (ever the adventurous eater) insisted on it. I'll admit the way they served it made it look pretty enticing. The  12-pieces of Snails were baked without the shell and cooked inside Garlic and Shallots. While I don't think I would be a regular consumer of Escargots, it wasn't as bad as I thought. I'd describe it as a bit rubbery with a nice garlicky butter taste.Hey, when your in a French spot, why not?For my main course after some big-time pondering over the steaks, i went with the Cotelettes D'Ageanu Romarin (damn I wish I could pronounce these words!) aka the Rack of Lamb. And man did they NAIL it. I went with it cooked Medium, and even though it may have came a little more on the medium-rare side each juicy bite was a taste of something special. The side of roasted new potatoes and heirloom carrots provided a healthy and photogenic spread of veggies to indulge in. This was the best roast of lamb I've eaten all year, if ever.Lets not forget about Dessert. Our table split two deserts of Chocolate Mousse and the Creme Brullet. Both were generously covered in whipped cream and strawberries. They could do no wrong this evening, as both were rich in flavor and taste. It hit the spot :).The service the entire night was on point. When I needed a drink the waiter was close-by, and despite getting busier closer to 7 pm the food all came out in a more than reasonable period.Look: it's not a cheap place by any means. But when you get great food , service, and decor all one spot it's worth every penny.Bien joué Boucherie. Bien joué.",18.40666666666667,0.2600494743351886

31,2018-10-23,5.0,"I came here on invitation from the manager as a follow up to their sister restaurant Olio e Piú.  It is a much larger restaurant than the former and the inside architecture is beautiful.We were treated graciously by the staff to two appetizers, two drinks, two entrees , and we opted to only go with 1 desert at the end.  I enjoyed the Boucherie Sazerac as a sweet liquorish like absinthe cocktail.  My girlfriend opted for the Gewurztraminer as a lightly sweet white wine.For starters we opted for the mussels and steak tartare.  The mussels were fresh and the sauce was a sweet white wine that went well with the crispy baguette slices.The steak tartare was delicious and well balanced with spices and fresh onion.  Our main dishes were the rack of lamb and the filet mignon with truffle butter. At first glance the rack of lamb is beautifully presented and the colors balanced well with the spinach greens and tomato.  My suggestion is to get the filet medium rare or even rare anything more well done will tend to dry up the meat as I could feel the ends starting to dry.  As with any large cut of meat that is going to pan seared.For desert we went for the pistachio bombe glacee, it was very rich and and creamy with chocolate all over. Overall our experience was great. Our server had left my girlfriend with a gift from the restaurant that depicts more of the work Boucherie does.Will definitely be coming back.If I were to suggest anything the restaurant had to improve to take it to the next level.  Our primary server was fantastic, it did seem like there were other people trying to take our orders as well which may make things unorganized.

34,2018-10-18,5.0,"I cannot recommend this place enough! I had a wonderful Sunday night dinner with my boyfriend and every detail of our night was perfect -- the ambiance, the service, the food. Every single dish was a standout.My boyfriend had the Spearmint cocktail and I had a glass of Sancerre to start. Both were great and went well with the appetizers: Raviolis aux Champignons. So good! The pasta tasted so fresh, the mushrooms were flavorful and juicy, and the truffle sauce with the ricotta stuffing was so creamy and paired so well together. Mousse de foie gras: I love foie gras and I understand people who don't like the taste but if you're going to try a foie gras try this one. It's creamy and smooth, perfect with the sweet caramelized red onions and the vinegary/lemony petit salad. The fresh grilled bread drizzled with olive oil was the perfect complement, giving the smooth foie gras the perfect crunchy base.For our main, we shared the Aloyau de boeuf pour deux. A 36oz dry-aged porterhouse that came with a mild and buttery bearnaise sauce. The steak was amazing, tender and medium rare on the inside and it looks like it was finished in the oven for a nice char on the outside. We prefer a bordelaise sauce and our server kindly gave it to us. We also ordered their fries on the side -- hands down best fries!!! The crunchiness and saltiness is awesome with the steak. Don't miss the fries. I repeat: DO NOT MISS THE FRIES. Along with the steak, I had a glass of Syrah, as recommended by our waiter. Outstanding. Bold and smooth, but not difficult to finish as it often happens when a glass of wine is too heavy and I am too full. Get this!Saving the best for last, the profiteroles. They changed my life. I can't tell you the amount of joy this dessert brings me. No dessert has made such an impression on me. The chocolate sauce is divine, the vanilla ice cream refreshing and sandwiched between warm and crunchy pastry puff. I would have licked the plate if it were socially acceptable to do so. If you don't get this dish when you're here, why are you here??10/10 would recommend :)",18.40666666666667,0.4591170634920636

48,2018-09-27,5.0,"Had a fantastic meal at Boucherie with a small group recently and could not be more impressed.  From the moment we stepped into the door until we rose from our seats at the end of the night, the service and attention to detail were impeccable through and through.We started off our evening with some of the cocktails they had on offer.  The boys opted for some variation of the Old Fashioned, and I, a summery watermelon based cocktail with absinthe.  I can't say much for the former, but my drink was refreshing yet assertive, a great precursor to the feast to come.  We sipped the cocktails slowly before moving onto wine later in the evening. For my appetizer I had the seared scallops over a tomato compote which was light and delicious.  The acidity of the tomatoes was a nice complement to the savory, umami flavor of the scallops. The portion was also large enough to be a main and I could have easily walked away from the meal and been completely satisfied.  Unfortunately I don't have that much self restraint so obviously I stayed for the next course, and the one after that...I ordered the seafood bouillabaisse (a Provençal fish stew) for my entree which was abundant with jumbo scallops, fish, clams, and shrimp. It was quite hearty and could be shared for those with smaller appetites.  The crusty bread and garlic aioli on the side were nice traditional touches.Dessert course was phenomenal.  Order the pistachio bombe and profiteroles...and I'll just leave it at that.Highly recommend for a great French meal with pleasant atmosphere and exceedingly good service.",18.40666666666667,0.3213605442176871

51,2018-09-25,2.0,"A friend and I have been meaning to try this place for dinner, but this particular Sunday afternoon we had already made plans in the area and thought we'd just at least check out the bar. We sit, and after a little longer then it should have taken to be noticed in an empty bar, we get approached for drinks, along with food/drink menus. I order a Martini, my friend orders a cocktail on the menu. We get them, his drink is amazing and mine is great too, as we expected. Then we ask for the bill when we were done, and see there was a $3 charge under my drink for 'martini'. We were very curious as to what this was, and called over the bartender. He basically said that it's added there because it being a cocktail and all, it has to be shaken, mixed, etc. His voice very low and soft, as if almost embarrassed himself to have to say it. Sort of cautious and a bit inaudible even.  I think we were in shock or too buzzed to even grasp this. I pay, and we leave. It comes up on our walk, because it just left an unsettling feeling in both of us. To be clear, it wasn't the $3. It just seemed so ridiculously bizarre for a 'tax' to be added to something that is part of the whole deal. They were both COCKTAILS!! They both had to be mixed and/or shaken!! That's a cocktail!! LOL!! WTF?! $3 more because its a martini??? Give me a break and bye bye Boucheri! (If I'm pronouncing that right, it rhymes with something that makes more sense now.)We will never try this place now, for fears we might be charged for a napkin or a replaced fork if one so happens to fall on the floor, or the floor to walk in on for that matter, or the fact the food needs to be served on plates, etc etc! Good luck with all that....",18.40666666666667,0.16401656314699795
52,2018-09-24,2.0,"I came here with a girlfriend on a Thursday night and decided to sit outside since the weather was still nice out. We were greeted quickly by the waitress and presented with the drinks and food menu. We both ordered a cocktail to start with and took a few minutes to decide on what to eat.We ordered the foie gras to start with, and then the bouillabaisse (mixed seafood in a saffron broth) and the 40 oz tomahawk rib-eye to share. (yes we were going all out since we were celebrating our reunion after not seeing each other for a while)They brought out our cocktails and a basket of bread first and unfortunately we had to immediately send back the bread. At first we weren't sure if we were seeing it correctly, but there was MOLD on the french bread that was brought out to us. Honestly this was the first time I've ever seen this at a restaurant (to my knowledge). I forgot to take a picture of it because I think we were both in such shock and quickly waved someone down to take it back and they were very apologetic and i'm sure also very embarrassed by this and brought out new bread for us. But this already kind of set a negative mood before the rest of our food came out. When our foie gras came out (with the same bread) we inspected every single piece very carefully because it's not super super obvious unless you happen to see the small specs.  The foie gras was very good, rich as it normally is so I wasn't able to eat too much of it. The seafood soup was also very flavorful, I would definitely recommend trying this. Finally, the 40oz tomahawk rib-eye. First of all, it was HUGE. I think with the amount of food we already ordered, it could have fed three of us ladies or just order one less app or entree next time if you want this steak. The steak was good, cooked medium rare like we asked for but there was a few pieces that were pretty fatty and we had to cut around for the meat. All in all, in terms of service and the rest of the entrees besides the moldy bread, it was a pleasant experience (I would have probably given them 4 stars if it wasn't for the mold) But because we found mold in the house bread, I'm not sure if I would come back to this location and I can't give them a higher rating. They need to have a better process of inspecting their food more accurately. It's not just stale bread, there was MOLD on it and it could have very well gotten people sick. And if we were served moldy bread, i'm sure there were other customers served moldy bread that night too.",18.40666666666667,0.12916822991822996

We said we needed more time . At that point he aggressively tried selling the most expense dish. Money is not an issue but I knew I didn't like ribeye so we opted for the filet migon for two which he recommend was just 'enough' to share. We also ordered the $26.00 escargot appetizer, while it was good it's was no better than my go to place that sells it for $8. We didn't even finish our appetizer and he was already trying to clear the plate, stating our food was on the way. When the food arrived it was a cow for a family of 6! This is great if you are hungry or dinning with a group but it was just too much for the two of us. As an experienced waiter he should have advised that this plate is a heapingfull for a group of 4 or more. Instead when we inquired, he said the 'menu' states it's for two, and it's an ""american' sized plate, acting as if he didn't know what was considered too much for two. I would not return to this restaurant because it serves platters of cows and pushes you thru like a cattle.

60,2018-09-14,4.0,"The only reason I gave four stars was that this otherwise beautiful date night was ruined by a third party. About the time after we finished our appetizers and were waiting for the main course, I heard a faint squeaking noise near the table. As I said we were outside, and at first I thought nothing of it; there were fans outside, might have been one of them. A little while later my girlfriend noticed it as well, as it had gotten a little louder. Then, one of the branches of a potted plant that was right next to/under our table started moving. Not too long after we saw two mice run from the potted plant, along the side of the building and off around the corner. We immediately informed the manager. I could understand if we had seen these mice come from off the street but they came from a plant that was touching me as I ate. I just think that there could have been some preventative actions that could have been taken.Other than that Boucherie was an amazing experience. I've previously been to their other locations, but this was the first time I visited their main location. We got to sit outside on a beautiful day, and it almost set the perfect ambiance, but I'll get to that in a little. The service started off a little slow, but once our waiter came he apologized and the rest of the evenening was wonderful. The food, again, delicious. I started off with the veal sweetbread and my girlfriend had the steak tartare and we shared. It was a great way to start the meal, flavorful and savory, and not too filling. For our main course I had the Steak Frites and she had the Filet Mignon. Both cooked, and seasoned, to perfection. And I don't know how they make the fries, or where they get them from, but you cannot stop eating those things. Unfortunately this time we were not offered the herb or truffle oil toppings for them, but tasty none the less. Finally, to end the night we just had to get the crepes again.

72,2018-08-29,4.0,"My friend texted me:  we'll be there for restaurant weekRestaurant Week is an inside joke between us.  At home in San Francisco we've repeatedly gone out during Restaurant Week, specifically because it's Restaurant Week, and somehow it goes down like this:* We eat somewhere that's not participating.  * We eat somewhere that's participating but we don't order off the Restaurant Week menu.  * We eat dinner somewhere that's participating only at lunch.  * Or even this: we eat somewhere only to realize that we're there the wrong week.  So it was not lost on either of us that I made reservations at Boucherie after seeing their Restaurant Week menu.  And even though they had a very attractive 3-course ($42) Restaurant Week offering?  Yeah, one of those things listed above happened.  It was sweltering outside and I opted for something far lighter than 3 courses and meat:  a Salade Nicoise  ($27) featuring seared Ahi was perfect.  The Boucherie Burger ($28) with fries was equally perfect and before you go into shock over that sticker price know that it was made from a blend of dry-aged Pat LaFrieda beef, a top-flight purveyor from whom Boucherie sources all their meat.  Truth be told, this is a meat place.  They even have a whole separate menu of red meat offerings which looked amazing though on this night, not amazing enough to circumvent my desire for a light meal.  The French Bistro menu here is similar to that at Balthazar though Balthazar wins on buzzy atmosphere and - I imagine - Boucherie wins on meat.  Aside from an awning that looked a little too much like low-market California chain Boulange, I thought Boucherie did a very nice job.

From beginning til end, was more than attentive and very helpful with all of our needs.Ambiance:The restaurant was a weird shaped triangle. I perhaps likes my restaurant shaped in a somewhat rectangular shape so I know where I'm facing. So throughout the night, I feel unsettling a bit. I'm 45 degrees to the outside window, 45 degrees to the back wall 20 ft away, the kitchen is oddly 120 degrees from where I'm facing. It just kind if leaves me ... I'm trying to find a better way to describe it but the best I could come up with was ""up in the air"".Furnitures are traditional French restaurant, nothing real fancy. Sorry, I'm a fancy type of girl when it costs triple digits per person with wine. Food:Porterhouse for two, not bad, had an extra smokey/flavor to it. Eggplant salad, not bad. Escargot, great.Total bill came out to be $220 before tips including two glasses of red. Everything was , well, not bad. Three stars. Service? Top notch. Five stars. So, four stars overall.

Steak was just okay and the sauce they gave me wasn't their peppercorn cream sauce but rather just dark brown peppercorn sauce which was too salty and overpowering. I asked the waiter about this and said that was the only sauce they have, which was strange given all the pics here on yelp suggests otherwise. The fries were crispy but coated with corn starch so these were more like diner fries. Definitely not worth the $47 for this dish and was really disappointed. The foie mousse for apps was great though. Service was alright, waiter prob said three words to us the entire night and just nodded as a sign he was ready to take our order.

I'm sure in spring or summer when the doors are open and the tables are out, it would be a great place for a few refreshing drinks!  I was here with a friend of mine and we initially started off at the bar with a few cocktails.  Our bartender was very pleasant and knowledgeable, and the bar itself was quite lively and busy on this Tuesday evening. After our drinks we moved to our table up on the 2nd level overlooking the restaurant and the kitchen... I recommend sitting here if you can!  Not the top level, but the terraced middle level.  Our server recommended the mussels as a starter and he did not steer us wrong; they were delicious! The plate was cleared and sauce soaked-up with the delicious bread!  We ate so much bread with the mussels I was worried about saving room for the main course!  But it was sooooo worth it! Get the mussels!For mains my friend had the NY strip and I had the rack of lamb.  The NY Strip was the way to go!  Perfectly cooked with the right amount of charring!  The lamb was good, but if I was to come here again I would definitely go with a steak. The table next to us was a business party of about 6. They had the ""butcher block"" which is essentially a board with an assortment of steak!! It was impressive, and I'm not going to lie, I was a bit jealous with food envy!  As for dessert I was so full at that point I could barely eat, but we tried the profiteroles.  They were light an airy which was good given how full we were!  Next time I want to try the chocolate mousse- my friend vetoed my choice!  Overall the atmosphere and service are excellent.   As for the food, get the mussels and steak!!! I would definitely come back, and this seems like a great place for groups as well.",13.795833333333334,0.3560621323121323

HOWEVER, my friend and I recently stopped by at 6:30 pm on a Wednesday evening and asked for a table outside for drinks and possibly snacks.  Only 3 tables were occupied.  About 10 - 15 tables available.  The hostess asked if we would eat dinner, we said we are not sure.  So she tried to seat us at a high bar table, where a family of four including 2 kids were seated.  I asked why I couldn't have one of the regular tables as there were SO MANY.  She said they are reserved.  I said if I were eating dinner, would they all of the sudden become 'Un-reserved', she said 'yes.'  So we left.  There you have it folks.

92,2018-08-14,5.0,"FOODGASM. My person and I had an opportunity to dine in this beautiful restaurant, compliments by the establishment. The restaurant is our unicorn of dining experiences thus far, from the Parisian decor, attentive staff and the piece of resistance, the French cuisine. For appetizers my person ordered the foie gras, with sweet onion jam compote and French bread. The combination of sweet jam and buttery foie gras were perfection. I had the mushroom ravioli with the black truffle fondue and burgundy truffles, decadent. We paired our starters with their impressive wine collection: his Cote du Rhone and mine, Sauvignon Blanc, both refreshing whites. Our main course was the show stopper of our dining experience. We shared the 40z tomahawk rib eye, roasted bone marrow, made in medium rare goodness. The meat was as expected: soft, juicy and packed with flavor. The umami of the bone marrow was the crux for me; I simply could not get enough. Our side dish Gratin de pommes was crispy, buttery and loaded with cheese, and complimented our main dish amazingly. The suggestion from the waiter to pair our meal with a glass of Bordeaux pulled all the palatable flavors together and was an excellent choice. The 40z is plenty for 3 people, so fortunately we were able to take some home and indulge for days. A must try! As for our dessert, we shared the pistachio bombe glacee, a brownie topped with pistachio ice cream. The pistachio nuts were subtle, keeping the ice cream soft, creamy, and refined. For presentation, chocolate syrup was poured onto the dessert by the waiter. I was a bit skeptical that the added syrup would make the dessert too sweet, but it was just the right amount of sweetness. The combination of flavors was like a party in my mouth, delicious!

The Strip Steak I found fairly underwhelming. The steak had a delicious char. But the texture (I ordered M.Rare) was a but too tough, dry, and lacked any fat or savor. The fries were super crisp, just oily enough, and had the perfectly broken starch interior which may have saved the 4th star for Boucherie. The dessert of mousse was good but very standard.

The restaurant was noisy - but not too noisy - just the right amount you'd want on a weekday evening at sunset for a meal with a friend, date, or casual drinks. I ordered the Lillet Spritz (great summer cocktail) and the Franco Mexican War (smoky mezcal - yum) - both which I highly recommend, and my friend ordered the Wildflower (not a huge fan of absinthe so thought it was only OK) and the Coccinella (refreshing summer drink!). The appetizers we ordered were also must-trys - mussels and truffle ravioli. But I honestly can't say enough about the steak. I ordered the Faux-Filet Bercy and it was extremely tender and flavorful.

107,2018-08-05,5.0,"Absolutely delicious. If you're looking for French cuisine, this is the complete spot. Boucherie is the ultimate spot to come for an anniversary or birthday. The ambiance and wall decor is perfect for a classic French bistro. With two floors, this place is huge. Don't forget to make reservations though because the place fills up within minutes. Boucherie is known for its steaks and absinthe cocktails, so go for those for the real experience. We started with the mussels in white wine vinaigrette and seared scallops with fennel. Both starters were perfectly light and their sauces packed lots of flavor. I generally don't like the taste of fennel but could barely taste it in the scallops. The scallops were seared only on one side and created a perfect combination of soft and hard. The sauce in the mussels was perfect to dip bread in or even just to drink. Although their absinthe cocktails are strong, we went for the boucherie old fashioned and spearmint house cocktails. I love whiskey, so the old fashioned was perfect for me. Props for the  presentation of the old fashioned in large cubes of ice. If you're not a heavy alcohol drinker, go for the Spearmint; it was a bit light in alcohol for me. Another favorite of mine, the Yamazaki 12 year old Japanese whiskey was strong and warms up your body as it runs through your esophagus; it is an ideal choice in the winter.Now the entrées. The pork was tasty and presented well with each pistachio placed meticulously on the filet, but the star of the show, no surprise to me, was the filet mignon. That thick steak just melted in my mouth. I thought the thick serving of truffle herb butter was going to be too much, but by the end of the meal, there was no trace of butter left on my plate. Their red wines pair well with the steaks. And to finish, we followed our server's advice and were thankful in getting the profiteroles. The 3 cream puffs were filled with vanilla ice cream and covered in chocolate sauce. It was a great way to finish a memorable dinner.",19.458333333333332,0.2838988095238094

We had the mussels, steak frites, and mousse and tarte for dessert and everything was delicious. We never felt rushed and had such a lovely evening and great table. Two three course dinners and a great bottle of wine brought our bill to $160 before tip which we thought was perfectly reasonable for our experience. My only reason for knocking one star is I would question how I would rate the food if it was the full price menu (mussels are $23 steak frites are a whopping $42) and the bill would have more than double the price which I would have found excessive for this.

We were seated at their balcony area inside. The manager Milos was so nice and offered to change our table before I told the waiter there were dripping from their ventilation pipe. 100% professional and great service. The menu is huge comparing to the table. I was a bit overwhelmed and I felt they used 100% of available space on the paper even added one more page for their butcher's menu. You sure will find something you like. Starting with cocktails, price range is similar to 99% of all places and i rate it above average. As their wine menu, the list is long. I saw many wine picked from Napa valley and couple French wine. Appetizer is a bit much.Instead of my usual order, I wanted their foie gra and tartare for our appetizer. Foie gra served with toasted bread and preserved beet is prefect. Please do smell it before eating and you won't regret. Tartare looks awesome and prefect for that Instagram picture. Normally not a fan of raw meat thou. Free bread is a bit hard to eat for me but I think it might be the weather drying but my friend said it's toasted. who knows. Fun part is the entree. Dover sole is sooo delicious. i still remember the lemony taste in my mouth after a day. I would go back for more but I don't want to be in financial trouble of course. Well seasoned and proper herbs, it's a perfect dish to be envy by your dining partner. So much so, she had to switch for my plate of fish. Ending with a plate of cut of the week isn't that bad. Asked for medium rare and it's prefect to my wish. I love how they served with veggie underneath instead of fries. Topped with a few delicious shrimp, I was in heaven. Dessert: I usually skip this part. We had their creme brulee and pistachio ice cream with champagne. That is how you end an anniversary dinner.

The starters and the main courses were certainly OK but nothing to make you burn to return.  Service very good but this is also one of the problems- on a quiet night, there were a lot staff trying to look busy, and they constantly and annoyingly were removing items from our table that were not quite finished, drinks and dishes.  Biggest issue for me were the frites.  When you are promoting yourself as a French restaurant and you offer steak frites, the frites need to be good.  These were horrible frozen entities with a thick coating of I don't know what, no better than what I would expect from a fast food joint or a late-night diner.  If you are a serious restaurant, what does it take to start with real potatoes?  I would only consider returning were I to hear that this was rectified.",18.268,0.0921666666666667
115,2018-07-30,5.0,"Before visiting Boucherie I have heard of the restaurant's Yelp event near last Christmas, which catered many traditional French dishes under the well lit Christmas tree. Glad that we were finally able to visit the restaurant this Sunday. We came around 8pm and was immediately glad that we made a reservation with the general manager Zorica ahead of time because it was fairly full. We chose to sit outside because the weather was nice, and were able to watch the sky color change through the course of our dinner. For appetizers, we had foie gras and steak tartare, both of which were delicious. Foie gras here was made as terrine (instead of seared). On the side were thin layered bread that went with the foie gras while not overbearing the taste. Steak tartare, much to my surprise, was savory despite being nearly raw. Daintily seared on the outside, the mix of red and brown made the dish looked appetizing. Raw quail egg on top also helped balance the could-have-been bare meat. Both appetizers were five stars here.Main course was good as well. We had the rack of lambs and 16 oz NY steak. Unlike American lamb which are cut to individual rack then seared on both sides with sauce, the rack of lamb here were cooked as a whole then cut to individuals. While the taste was more blend than what I am used to, it provided a different type of experience. NY steak came medium rare, exactly as requested. The meat was tender and easy to cut along the texture. Taste had a tint of sweetness at first followed immediately by a warming mix of salt-seared richness. Main course was good, but perhaps because the restaurant was occupied, the dish and the plate itself were slightly cold by the time they arrived. This perhaps would be the one suggestion I would give if any. Finally the dessert was impeccable. We asked for raspberry sorbet because the Yelp photos of multi-colored pink sorbet looked marvelous. Not shocking, the sorbet was fresh, light, and easily melted upon eating. I can't describe the blissful taste well so recommending that anyone who's interested to try it yourself! The dessert was perhaps our favorite part of the meal.Before ending the note, I also want to add that the service was good. The assistant general manager had checked on us before leaving to ask if everything went well, which I can appreciate. Dinner was overall a great experience and I certainly look forward to coming back.",17.746666666666666,0.27072793558642616

Food was delicious and easily 5/5 stars. The strip steak was cooked perfectly to my request (medium rare), well-seasoned, and juicy (wasn't pre-cut). The peppercorn sauce was delightful and complimented the steak very well. Cocktails, although on the pricey side even for NYC ($16), were fantastic. I would highly recommend the Wildflower for gin and absinthe lovers.Service, however, was mediocre. We were not offered any bread and our wait staff checked up on us infrequently (e.g. water was not refilled more than once, and it took quite a long time to get anyone's attention for the check), despite our table being located right next to the registers and staff area. Sunday night wasn't particularly crowded, so there's no excuse. I'm surprised that service was this slow and inattentive--you would think they would be extra well-staffed in preparation of Restaurant Week.All in all, definitely come for the food (they can cook a mean steak) and cocktails, but be mindful that the service is nothing to rave about.",15.729166666666666,0.2231006493506494

Here is what we ordered:Wine: they have a very good selection of wine and we ordered two rounds of wines.The white wine was light and tasty, goes well with the appetizers and bread. When we are considering pairings for our meat, they allowed us to try two samples of red wines when we cannot decide on which ones to take. My friend and I ended up picking different red wines after tasting the samples. It seems like I like the lighter ones and she prefers the rich ones. We both love them a lot!Bread: good as usual. No complains.Mousse De Foie Gras：A very special combination of the savory and rich foie gras and the sweet and refreshing thing. It almost feels like it were two dishes when you try them with the bread, and the combination of both is just fantastic.Mussels: A good bland of flavors. It is lightly seasoned so you can taste the freshness of the ingredients.Medium Hanger steak: the sauce makes the steak juicer and my friend loves it! The sauce was not salty at all, but just rich. It really gave a nice touch to my steak.Medium rare Filet Deboef: I personally love this more than the hanger steak. The medium rare filet is still juicy, and when you combine it with the vegetables they supply it becomes less heavy, making me want to eat more and more nonstop. I rarely find the combining the green vegetables with the steaks and I do believe this is a very good pair. Highly recommended!Services: very attentive and efficient. We got our appetizers and wines within 15 minutes and we finished all our food in about 1 hour.A very good five star restaurant! Would love to come back :)",21.354545454545452,0.3145757020757021

130,2018-07-24,5.0,"Boucherie is located on the bustling 7th Ave. As you approach, you'll see tons of outdoor seating to enjoy in the nice weather. Inside, you'll be greeted by a host and find an array of tables located in a beautifully decorated dining area. Something unique you'll also find is their skylight in the center of the ceiling. Coming into Boucherie on a lively Monday evening made it feel like it was already Thursday. After we were seated, we were presented with a cocktail/wine menu as well as some bread, butter and roasted red peppers. I opted to start with the Wildflower, which just has a hint of licorice (absinthe) taste. It was a nice balance. My boyfriend got the Bastille Sour and enjoyed it as well (we love drinks with egg white!). For appetizers we opted to try the Niçoise salad and the mussels. The mussels came in a white wine broth and were good, but a couple of the mussels weren't fully open. The salad encompassed seared tuna and a perfectly dressed arugula salad. I would definitely recommend this if you want something on the lighter end. We had a difficult time choosing our entrees since most of the steaks sounded fantastic. The waiter was able to assist with that. We ended ordering the Steak Frites (one of their most popular steak dishes) and the Filet de Boeuf. The Steak Frites is a bit of a heavier dish - it has an amazing peppercorn sauce and comes with fries. It was cooked well and was filling so we couldn't end up finishing it all (couldn't let it go to waste so we got it to go). The Filet de Boeuf is the one thing you DO NOT want to miss out on. It was one of the most tender filets I've ever had and it was topped with truffle butter nonetheless. If I came back for just one dish, it would be the Filet. We couldn't leave without dessert and our indecisiveness led us to order two - the Tartin and the Pistachio Bombe. These desserts are complete opposites. The Tartin is basically an apple tart which is extremely flaky accompanied by vanilla ice cream. The pistachio ball is essentially pistachio ice cream on top of a brownie, topped with dark chocolate syrup. If you want something decadent I would go with that. If you're looking for something on the lighter side, an apple tart is the way to go. Overall I had a great meal and amazing service. I'm still thinking about that Filet..",22.736666666666657,0.28675324675324676

133,2018-07-22,5.0,"The best way I can describe dinner at Boucherie is an out-of-body experience and even that, I'm confident, doesn't do it justice. First, if you're looking for a break from the traditional American influenced fine dining, that is typical of New York City, I'd say give this place a try. You won't be disappointed. It's not just another gimmicky restaurant that sports a French attitude, in name only, but it indeed serves up classic French cuisine with a modern take. We began with the mushroom ravioli and mussels as our hors-d'oeuvres. Transitioned to steak and salmon for the entrees and finished it off with creme brûlée for dessert. Everything was delicious, as we had hoped for and expected, but what made the experience even better is the customer service. From the time we were greeted by the maitre d' until the time we left the restaurant, there was a feeling of warmth we experienced the entire time. Our waiter, Sidy, was phenomenal. Funny, charming and knowledgeable about the entire menu, even offering suggestions we took and were not disappointed with. Other waiters and servers also checked on us, as they passed. There was not once ever a time we needed anything. One of the few restaurants in New York in which I've experienced great urgency from a restaurant's staff. We were also greeted by the manager-on-duty, Emil, who also wanted to make sure we were satisfied with the food. The food is more pricey than your average restaurant, but it won't break the bank, and the quality is unmatched, and experience is unparalleled.

This was all so delicious and well prepared. The portion size was average, but the quality of ingredients made up for it.My favorite dish was definitely the faux-filet bercy which was prepared medium and had the perfect texture.We finished off dinner with crème brûlée and pistachio bombe glacee.

135,2018-07-20,5.0,"As is the motto of Boucherie, the joie de vivre (joy of life) is best cultivated around a table with great friends and delicious food. Inside this modern yet classic French establishment is an upscale dining experience that provided me this kind of joy - one that I believe will prove quite memorable even as the hair grows grayer on my head and parts of my body become dysfunctionally limp. For the appetizer, I ordered the mousse de foie gras. It came with perfectly toasted pieces of french bread and a sweet onion jam compote. Simple. Heaven. The foie gras was a buttery, creamy delight that I spread luxuriously over the bread like a meaty cream cheese before devouring. I was already in my happy place.Next up, the entree - a filet de boeuf - a true star of the show. Each bite was a powerfully seductive romantic experience. It was as if I had never truly had a real steak ever before in my life. Juicy. So Juicy. Tender. So Tender. The meat had such a melt in your mouth quality to it that even my friend who primarily enjoys chicken above all meats, took a bite and found it delicious.Just when I thought I had experienced the best food of the evening, a trio of exquisitely prepared desserts - Profiteroles, Pistachio Bomb Glacee and Creme Brulee - sauntered onto the table and into my mouth. The pistachio bomb was a beautiful construction with soft pistachio ice cream perched atop a crispy brownie bottom. Then, with glitz and glam, chocolate syrup is poured on top table-side. The profiteroles were also phenomenal - light & airy puffs of deliciousness.  Shoutout to Sidy for his exceptional service throughout the night.

136,2018-07-19,4.0,"Appetizers:Foie Gras - Buttery, creamy perfection. Hands down one of my favorite appetizers at either Boucherie location.Escargot - Served steaming hot and stays hot for a long while! The butter is herby and the escargot is plump and more plentiful than you'd first expect. Downside is that due to the plumpness of the escargot, the herbed butter flavor isn't as well incorporated.Entree:Tomahawk Steak with Bone Marrow - 40 oz that we split between 2 people. We can eat, so we pretty much polished this off on our own, but I can see this feeding 3 maybe 4 people depending on their appetites and what else they order. Some pieces were mostly fat or more well done than we'd prefer, but those are closer to the edge and definitely in the minority. The sauce was too salty for our tastes, so we used it sparingly. Instead, we recommend pairing your bites of steak with some of the bone marrow, which is incredibly buttery and melts in your mouth. Beware of letting this sit too long though, or it'll start to coagulate.Desserts:Pistachio Bombe Glacee - Great way to end the meal. You basically get to have warm cake and cool ice cream all in one. And you get to have chocolate and pistachio and vanilla flavors all in one. For some reason, we liked this dessert more at the Flatiron location, but it may have just been luck of the draw. The chocolate poured over the dessert there seemed to have been thicker and hardened better over the little dessert dome.Chocolate Mousse - Pretty standard and classic. Can't really go wrong.Drinks:Lillet Spritz - Bubbly and refreshing. Kind of how I wish frosé would make me feel, but always falls short of.Yamazaki 12-Year-Old Japanese Whisky - This is potent and an amazing drink to sip at throughout your meal. Every sip is a deep warmth you can feel all the way from your lips to the center of your chest.Some hiccups in service:When we first arrived, we stood around for quite awhile before anybody noticed we were there and came to seat us.We had ordered a ginger ale and had to speak to 3 different people before it was brought over.Otherwise, service was attentive and checked in on how we were doing.",11.104166666666666,0.2851608187134503

The jazz music in the background is a nice touch, not too noisy and can still have conversations. To start, the table gets bread and butter. The butter is really really good. I want to keep eating it. The bread is good also. Could be crispier, but that butter, just keep spreading it. Don't get stuffed on the bread as the entrees are surprisingly huge, especially considering it's French, which is usually much smaller.For the appetizer, we had the Escargots de Bourgogne. Mmm..delicious. It's soaked in a hot buttery sauce with garlic. Very hot when it first comes out. Super tasty. So good I dipped the bread in the remaining sauce.For the entrees, we had the Faux-Filet Bercy (NY strip) and the Filet de Porc Roti (pork tenderloin). The steak was quite tasty. It comes in pre-cut thick slices and with the bone along with some salad that goes well with the steak. The pork tenderloin comes in big chunks with some vegetables on the side - carrots, spinach and shallots. We had it cooked to medium, like a steak. The portions are quite big. Great for sharing and trying different dishes. We also got a side of ratatouille. This is really good. Goes well with the steaks.For dessert, we shared the Profiteroles. It is 3 separate cream puffs with ice cream between it and chocolate sauce. A must have. The ice cream is so good, especially on a hot day.Can't miss drinks with the meal.

I had to stop myself. The ravioli was also really good. The mushrooms on top added a layer of texture that delights the palate. My dining buddy ordered the salmon which looked great. It sat in a bed of asparagus and I think a hollandaise sauce. I have been on a steak streak, so I ordered the steak frites au Louvre. It was very tender and the pepper sauce was just right. The French fries were not the best, but the crunch and soft inside made them palatable. Now I'm stuffed. However I haven't popped, so I ordered the lime sorbet. It was just what I needed.

But because some of us were vegetarian/vegan, 5 of the group shared the platter and the rest of us got individual entrees.I got the branzino, and it was the perfect combination of crispy skin and tender flesh. Edible flowers and herbs also made it so beautiful I couldn't bring myself to eat it... but I did anyway bc it smelled so good.The mussels were also great. I tried some of the bone marrow and it was flavorful, yet salty.

145,2018-07-12,5.0,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful dinner at Boucherie on Wednesday night. The restaurant was quite busy at 7:30pm, but with a reservation we were seated immediately. We sat on the lower balcony level overlooking the restaurant, allowing us to take in the ambience and decor, both of which were quite nice. Soaring floor to ceiling glass doors adorn the front wall of Boucherie, letting in plenty of light and a pleasant summer breeze. The bar is very impressive, with huge stained glass mirrors. We particularly liked the large mirror behind us with the engraved daily specials - it gave the menu a sense of tradition. Overall, the space is classy, well decorated, and romantic. It is quite loud however, good for a fun date but not quiet conversation. We started with a red wine and the Bastille Sour cocktail - surprisingly light with lemon but creamy from the egg white. Highly recommend this whiskey sour. For appetizers, we ordered the Escargots de Bourgogne and Raviolis aux Champignons. The escargot came nearly instantly, with the butter still sizzling. Really good, buttery and garlic flavor that we couldn't resist dipping our bread into after the escargot was done. Unfortunately, our other appetizer was neglected and arrived at the same time as our two entrees. The waiter came later to apologize for the mistake, which we appreciated. The mushroom ravioli was probably my favorite of the meal. It had a very rich truffle flavor with a creamy sauce and delicious mushrooms bits. For entrees, we had the Wednesday special: Sole a la Grenoblaise and the Faux-Filet Bercy (essentially NY strip steak). The sole was one of the best fish entrees I've had - buttery tenderness that paired nicely with the tangy acidity from the capers and the crunchy texture of the toasted bread pieces. The steak was perfectly cooked at medium rare, seared well with good seasoning, although the salad paired with it was a bit bland. Finally, we had the creme brûlée for dessert. It was actually quite a large portion so perfect to share. Good vanilla flavor and caramelization with strawberries and raspberries on top. Overall, we had a great experience at Boucherie. Service was very attentive, and they took accountability for any small mistakes. The food was fantastic - some of the best French food I've had in the city. The restaurant itself is beautiful, romantic, and lively. We really enjoyed our time here.",15.912121212121212,0.3065813492063492
146,2018-07-11,5.0,"Boucherie is like being transported to summers in France. I've been to the Boucherie on Park by Union Square as well, but this West Village location really holds my heart. The decor, open doors, patio seating, and all the natural light that comes from the clear doors and skylight above - all lend to levity, laughter, and happiness. And the Rosé they stock is perfect - dry, crisp, and served very cold.The food is a honestly a bonus. Some of my favorites:- Saint Jacques a la Provencal: perfectly seared scallops.- Mousse de foie gras: one of the best mousses I've had. Tasted even better when spread on the warm, buttery, airy toast points.- Steak Frites: you can really taste the quality of the meat, paired with a lovely pepper sauce. The fries are also crisp and very airy.We also had the Pistachio Bombe Glacee for dessert, which although it was hard to taste the pistachio flavor and was more textural, just tasted like an amazing ice cream sundae.The prices are definitely higher than what I'd normally spend on a weeknight dinner but you can taste the quality and Boucherie is a great choice for a special occasion or just a time to treat yo self.",17.566666666666666,0.3740299823633158

152,2018-07-04,5.0,"It was very easy to find the place in the heart of West Village and it was very cute outside near the entrance.  Getting the reservations involved some work and confusion with the host, but once we arrived they were accommodating in terms of where we wanted to sit.  The minute you walk into the restaurant you feel as if you're in France in a intimate, cozy setting.  The traditional brasserie and steakhouse infuses a plethora of dining options.  It manages to keep its timeless traditions while trying to cater to the New York crowd.  We started off by ordering two glasses of Jean Michel Gerin which tasted like a combination of Malbec and Pinot Noir.  The bread and butter were very tasty and it was a nice combination with the olives, sundried tomatoes, and the tomatoes stuffed with tuna.  I wanted to introduce my boyfriend to Foie gras as the French are known for it and I'm glad I ordered it.    The Hudson Valley Foie gras was delicious w/ onion compote and red wine port sauce.  It went very well with the toasted bread and side salad.  Unexpectedly the Sauté De Ris De Veau aux Morilles was excellent.  It had a rich, deep flavor because of the creme fraiche.  It consisted of veal sweet breads, morel mushrooms, and asparagus.For our main dishes I ordered the Filet de Boeuf because I love filet mignon and truffle butter.  My boyfriend ordered the Faux-Filet de Bercy.  His 16oz Pat La Frieda dry-aged bone in NY strip wasn't exactly cooked medium rare.  It was a bit too rare and mine also.  However, overall the dinner was great even though the service was a bit too attentive.  We ended the night with profiteroles at the waiter's suggestion.  I wanted to say thank you to the manager Zorica for the opportunity to visit and dine at Boucherie.",22.665625000000002,0.30326298701298704

We started with some charcuterie whatever the server Dragomir (I think he is French) recommended to us and the steak tartare which he combined with a nice glass of wine with that course. For main course we had the pork tenderloin and the rack of lamb cooked to perfection. The space inside reminds me of old restaurants in Paris but much bigger and ambience is very authentic and really relaxing.

The restaurant was fairly busy but the service was attentive.We started off with cocktails and the steak tartare and sweetbreads with morels in cream sauce. Both dishes were delicious! In fact, it's been quite some time since I had an excellent steak tartare. For entrees we shared the filet mignon and the duck confit. The steak was very good of course but the duck was the more memorable dish of the two. Highly recommended! And for a sweet finish we shared the pistachio mousse with a chocolate ganache. The chocolate was delightful! All in all, it was a lovely dinner!

The restaurant is also located in a super sexy area of the West Village so you have some great walking choices for an after dinner drink. But wait there's more.

With her engaging smile, charisma, and charm she helped us navigate the menu and we didn't leave disappointed. Specifically, she recommended the hanger steak and tarte tatin. Wow wow wow! My advice to management is you have a rising star in Zeina and she definitely is being underutilized in her current capacity.

Presented with bone marrow to further extend your dining experience.  A decadent savory treat.  The restaurant has a special menu for steaks and display French technique in preparing meats, and a separate menu that offers enough diversity for every palate.  The food presented beautifully with a warm welcome from the hosts.  The restaurant is an open concept with a direct view of the kitchen. Our dining experience starts and ends on a high note. The foie gras mousse came with perfect accouterments of a citric frisee salad, charred bread, and sweet caramelized onions.  The mussels in wine sauce had a wonderful leek aromatic.  The cheese plate had French options and we ordered the  duck breast from the charcuterie board.  For dessert, we had crème brulee with a wonderful light creamy consistency.  In addition, the bomb has a dark chocolate sauce that I want to take home!The menu has the classics.  My cousin enjoyed her roasted chicken with perfectly crispy skin.  The Sole Meuniere was cooked properly but over seasoned.  Salty and too many capers for my palette.  You must order the ratatouille as I would have enjoyed it as my main course.This spot is great for groups.  It did get noisy toward the end of the evening with a full house.

173,2018-06-17,4.0,"The service here is phenomenal- dishes are timed perfectly, seating is immediate, great ambiance. The servers and waiters are extremely aware of table seating, who ordered what, when to check in their tables, etc.The food was good. We had quite a few people, so we got to order a lot of dishes to try, but the menu is really diverse and extensive. I'm definitely going back to try the others. The plating technique here is so beautiful too.1. Escargots- This dish is a must-get. The escargots are piping hot when they come out, so be careful. But these little guys packed a punch of flavor.2. Mussels- I don't eat mussels regularly, I hate them. But I had a few from this dish. They were tender, but the star of this dish was that white wine sauce. It was good, I had to dip bread bread in there.3. Steak tartare- There were so many strong flavors on this dish, but they all melded together beautifully. The quail egg was a pretty touch. This dish is also one I'd get again.4. Branzino- By far the prettiest dish of that dinner, it was sprinkled with different edible flower petals (definitely Instagram-worthy). My friend, who was a chef, said it was a unique-looking dish, the fish was good.5. Rack of lamb- The friend who ordered this one inhaled the plate. It was very filling, and the meat was perfectly cooked, tender and juicy.6. Duck leg confit- We had high hopes for this dish, as it's something I've had at other restaurants and it had great reviews as well. Unfortunately, it missed the mark. It was a little too dry, such that it was a little hard to swallow. The flavors were good, and the frisee it came with balanced the dryness out a bit. The dish, though, didn't impress.7. Faux-filet bercy- I ordered this NY strip medium-rare, but one end seemed overcooked. One end was rare and the other was medium. It wasn't evenly cooked, but the meat was still tender and juicy and flavorful. The dish came with just a small frisee and no sauce. I ate the steak fine without sauce, but I wish potatoes and sauce were an addition to the dish. Overall, it was just okay.The appetizers we ordered were unique and so good that I'd come back just for them. The entrees, with the exception of the branzino and the rack of lamb, were a little lackluster. None of the entrees were especially memorable taste-wise. Perhaps the kitchen was busy, and it was just not great timing. I wish the duck leg confit was as delicious as everyone else claimed it to be. We wouldn't come back specifically to order any of the entrees we ordered this is time, but I'll be back for apps and hopefully, the entrees are better next time!Just a tip- avoid sitting on the outer edge of the outside dining area. People were constantly taking smoke breaks over our food (surprised that the no-smoking rule isn't more enforced). The parent of two children in a table next to us also seems bothered by it. People were also coming straight up to the tables and panhandling. This wasn't the restaurant's fault, so it didn't affect the review.",12.0,0.19377777777777772

She didn't even bother to make eye contact with us as she told us, but I'm sure she was busy prepping. Although, I get that we were there early and had to wait ten minutes for the restaurant to open--no problem. The part I didn't appreciate? She immediately let a different couple sit down and started servicing them. Not cool. I'd give her 1 Star if it was based on her alone. Food:We each ordered a hefty croque madames. Very yummy and buttery! Lots of veggies too. Just make sure to come with a very empty stomach. I ordered a (very tiny) coffee cup for $4 served in a little tea cup. Tasted pretty watered down though. Thumbs up for the croque madames, thumbs down for the coffee. I'd go again. It was good food, but nothing outstanding. Cute place to bring your parents or people out of town, though.

181,2018-06-08,4.0,"Had a fantastic time here last night -  we sat outside as the weather was still warm enough to manage. Alison was our server and was extremely attentive throughout the entire meal. She gave us her opinions between choices we gave her, but also offered suggestions of her own which we appreciated. From the cocktails menu we got an aperol spritz and then a Coccinella. I got the Coccinella, which was a little thicker than I had expected, but it was likely due to the strawberry juice. It tasted great though. To start, we split the fig and prosciutto salad. The presentation of the salad was stunning, but taste wise was a little lacking - the figs might not have been ripe enough to give it enough flavor. The portion was a good size, especially for an app - it didn't ruin our appetite but was substantial enough to align with the price. We then split the frisee salad. Now this was amazing. A little hard to eat, as frisee tends to be (definitely don't order it on a date!), but so worth it. The bacon was delicious and perfectly cooked. It was fantastic and the shallots added the perfect amount of flavor!We then got the larger steak tartare as one of our mains. This was definitely a portion on the smaller side, but hard to tell because it was served kind of flattened on the plate. The presentation looked nice, but had we not been splitting so many things, I don't think it would have been big enough as a main course. Not their fault - just suggesting people don't count on doing the same! The second main course we split was the hanger steak - this was AMAZING. Such good quality meat and the sauce was really tasty. Alison kindly offered to bring us some bread for the sauce which we gladly took her up on. I do wish it had come with a side of fries or something along those lines, but had we read the menu more carefully we would have noted that it did. It was served completely on it's own. The portion itself was extremely reasonable - I'm not sure if it said how many ounces on the menu, but it was more than enough. I am still thinking about how flavorful it was!For dessert my friend got the chocolate mousse. It was served in a cup with whipped cream and strawberries. Super rich yet light which was great!

183,2018-06-07,4.0,"Had this place reserved for Memorial Day Brunch because the beautiful and quaint ambiance of the store was an instant sell for me. Ordered the eggs benedict (not a proper brunch without it), omelette au choix, and confit de canard pommes salardaises. Eggs benedict and omelette au choix were both quite solid; the Confit duck leg, however, I've had better -- the pairing was not the best as the combination of both chips and confit duck leg made the dish quite greasy (try Ace Hotel Whitfield for an amazing combo -- grapefruit marmalade + escarole = perfection!!) Coffee here is also very strong if you dig that. Overall, a pleasant, and nice (But PRICEY$) experience! Would come here again when I can afford to spend a pretty penny again-- most likely in the summer when the full length doors are all open and the seating spills onto the sidewalk as well.

The service was impeccable and the manager went out of her way to ensure that we had a perfect Boucherie experience. To start, we both had the onion soup which was delicious and filling for an appetizer. For our main dishes, I had the salmon which was paired with a delicious, buttery sauce and asparagus, cooked to perfection. My boyfriend opted for the filet de boeuf (I believe), which he asked to be cooked very rare. He enjoyed this as well. For dessert, we shared the profiteroles. This was a huge dessert perfect for sharing. We look forward to returning! Great date spot, wonderful service, and intimate & classy ambiance.",11.224390243902441,0.5804444444444443

Frisée salad with lardons was excellent, just the right amount of oil and the soft egg was an nice touch. The French onion soup was good, but could use a little more bite from the onion. The filet was melt in my mouth, with the truffle butter. The Star was the truffle ravioli with mushrooms and the upside down apple crumble.... wow. Great atmosphere and service was very attentive. My reason for 4 not 5 is that they sat us in the middle of the restaurant when we preferred a table next to the open doors looking out into the street due to the section being ""closed"".

191,2018-05-29,4.0,"I was invited back to Boucherie to give the restaurant another go as my first visit was disappointing. I Yelp allowed half stars so I could bump it to a 4.5, b/c this visit really shined.  From the beginning to the end of the meal, the experience was like night and day.  The server was attentive and made awesome recommendations.  He steered us to the fig salad, which I would have never noticed on the menu.  He said it was a light appetizer that was flavorful and a good start to the meal.  He was right.  The figs and prosciutto were flavorful and fresh and there were sprigs of greens and tomato present.He also helped us navigate the wine list and allowed us to sample the wines before deciding on the bottle.  It's a good thing, b/c I did not love the Chateauneuf du Pape I sampled.  It wasn't bad, but not my cup of tea.  My guest and I settled on a lovely bottle of Bordeaux.  For the main portion of the meal, we split the porterhouse cooked rare.  We also ordered sauteed spinach, but unfortunately that was delivered toward the end of our dinner after having asked for it twice.  The meat was cooked to order and had good flavor.  The steak was tender and it was great being able to share two different cuts.  The server was apologetic about the spinach and it was delivered along with some more wine as we had finished our bottle.  The spinach was delish and is a great side to accompany the steak.For dessert we ordered the pistachio dessert which was incredible.  I don't generally love pstachio anything, but this thing was damn good.  My guest also ordered an espresso.  He had to take a call before dessert and the server was nice enough to replace his espresso with a fresh one as it had been setting out and had turned cold.All in all, service was lovely, friendly and attentive.  The server helped us navigate the menu and made great recommendations.  All of the food we ate was delicious and had great presentation.  This experience is what I expected my first go around and I'm happy I was able to give it another shot.  The ambiance was great and we were able to dine al fresco and enjoy the West Village views.  Thank you to the Boucherie team for making my second visit memorable. I will definitely be back to try more of the menu selections in the near future!",17.360000000000003,0.3553206997084549

Everything was delicious but my favorite was definitely the steak tartare. It was SO GOOD.. the quail egg mixed perfectly and the flavors were fantastic. The chicken would probably be a close second.

In the summer it feels fresh and airy and in the winter, warm and cozy. The massive mirror behind the bar makes the space feel twice as big as it actually is (which is already pretty large for NYC). The staff is amazing. Everyone is friendly and goes above and beyond to make sure you have the best dining experience possible. During one of my visits the bartender felt that it took too long for our group to get our drinks. To make up for it, he ordered us an appetizer on the house. They truly want to make sure you have the best dining experience possible and the second they feel it's less than perfect they pull out all the stops to improve it. Be sure to order a Boucherie old fashioned. It's made with tequila and is super smooth. Once you try one you will be hooked. The sazerac is also delicious. You can't really go wrong with any of the food on their menu but steak is what they are famous for. Also try the french onion soup, escargot, and creme brulee!",17.360000000000003,0.31400513067179736
194,2018-05-28,5.0,"Probably my favorite French restaurant in NYC! We started the night greeted by Zorica and were seated immediately. The Christmas decorations were so cute and out of this world! Perfectly dimmed and a great date spot if you want to treat your s/o for the holidays. There was also a giant tree in the middle which I was a huge fan of  For drinks my table got two bastille sours and a pocketsquare--both were amazing but my favorite was the pocketsquare! Sweet and fruitbut with a strong kick.Appetizers: We got the foie gras and escargot and BOTH WERE OUT OF THIS WORLD. The foie gras had a soft, pate texture that was served with toasted bread and a side of greens. But what put this dish over the top for me was the caramelized onions!! It complemented the foie gras and greens perfectly. I can't wait to take my mom here because she loves foie gras and I finally have a good place for her try it!The escargot came out piping hot with butter that was so good I was literally about to drink it--it took all I had in me not to lift the plate and do it. It was also the first time I've ever had snails and I'm so glad I tried it! There were 6 and one of the people I was eating with took the last one and I swear a part of my heart actually broke.For our mains we got the filet minon and veal--I personally don't like tough meat so the veal wasn't my favorite, however the jus and sweetbreads were very delicious. The plating was also beautiful.The filet minon with truffle butter is something you HAVE to get if you're ordering a cut of meat. It was sooooo tender and juicy and cut like a hot knife through butter. We got it medium rare which I definitely think is the way to go. The truffle butter was also so decadent--we lapped it up like a thirsty dog.We capped off the night with their crème brulee which was so creamy and delicious but by this time of the night we were stuffed (I was actually about to unbutton my pants but decided against it since this was a very classy place).Overall this restaurant is remarkable. The whole layout of the place was very unique as was the food, company, and décor. Our waiter Chris was also so friendly and attentive (as was the rest of the wait staff). He had a French accent which really just was the cherry on top of the entire night!

When we first arrived, we were greeted warmly by the staff and they made sure to always check up on us and was always prompt in bringing what we needed. We ordered the scallops which were seared perfectly and paired with crushed tomatoes, roasted garlic and fennel seed. The scallops were really meaty and the tomato based sauce was the perfect acidity to flavor the dish. Additionally, we had the squid ink linguini with shrimp and sepia in a tomato based sauce - it was perfectly seasoned and well-balanced. As someone who doesn't really like tomato based sauces, I was very impressed with how these two dishes were executed and thoroughly enjoyed both.For the entree, we ordered the 40 oz tomahawk ribeye with roasted bone marrow and borderlaise to share. It was a beautiful sight to behold. Steak was perfectly medium rare and had a nice char without being burned. Also, perfectly seasoned too - most places are heavy on the salt but I really appreciated tasting the actual meat. Additionally, I highly recommend the fries at Boucherie - they're so addictive that we had two orders. I don't know how they do it but it's the perfect potato to crunch ratio!Lastly, for dessert, we had the profiteroles which was such a nice end to the meal - highly recommend.

Everything was wonderful, the escargot was buttery, the mussels were plumped and the white wine sauce it was cooked in was great, don't waste it dipping your bread in it! The French fries that came with the New York strip were moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside just the way I like them.  My favorite and hands down the best part of the meal was the filet mignon.  It was cooked perfectly medium rare and every bite just melts in your mouth.

When I arrived, we were immediately seated and had the option of sitting on the floor level, bar, outdoor, by the kitchen, mezz, and upper level. We picked the mezzanine level and was extremely satisfied with the view of the entire restaurant. There was great lighting and a slight breeze from the open windows.I started of with a glass of pinot noir which was perfectly paired with the steak frites I planned to order. To start, my friend and I shared escargot and it came in a hot plate already deshelled immersed in a buttery, garlic sauce. I dipped some bread in the sauce and it was delicious. I ordered the steak frites medium rare. The steak was cooked to perfection and my mouth watered before every bite. The fries were super crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was impeccable. Every day of the week, Boucherie has a special and different dish. I went on a Sunday and the special was Lapin Chasseur (or braised rabbit with spinach). My friend enjoyed the dish very much. To finish off the dinner, we ordered the Pistachio Bombe Glacee to share per the Assistant Manager's recommendation, and it was nothing I've tasted before. It has a thin to moderate layer of chocolate cake/brownie base with pistachio ice cream topped with hot fudge which congeals a bit. Each bite was to die for! I will definitely go back just dessert! Words cannot describe it.. I had an amazing dinner with an attentive waiter. I would give it 10 stars if I could!

I sat in the mid-level area overlooking the ground floor and was very happy to get Sidy again. He is helpful, friendly with a warm smile. A very big THANK YOU to Zorica for arranging the evening and having us as guests. It was incredibly generous.As I waited for my friend to arrive I started with a signature absinthe inspired cocktail - sazerac. Sweet with some bitterness and punch. All the cocktails here are VERY good. I also got to try the Manhattan which was delicious as well. I appreciated Emile dropping in to make sure I had a drink in hand. As for the food, everything was delicious but the stand outs were the mushroom ravioli and escargot. The ravioli was cheesy and mushroomy with a nice springiness and chew. The snails were buttery and could be enjoyed alone or with some bread. For our main dishes we had the duck which was crispy and seasoned nicely but could use some sauce on the side. When I see monk fish I have to order it. The fish was good but the sauce was dynamite. I even dipped my fries in it because I couldn't get enough. I also want to mention how crispy and tasty the fries were. The crispiness almost reminds me of Burger King fries.Although we didn't have any room left for dessert, we ordered the Crêpes Suzette and somehow made room. It was soft, sweet (without being overly sweet), with some cold refreshing ice cream on the side. On a side note, this used to be the old garage which I really like for live music but it was a little grimy. Boucherie is much prettier with an upscale French bistro style. It is very inviting.

The cheese was accompanied with green apples, honey & candied nuts. For dinner we shared the porterhouse for 2 (it has some fancy French name that starts with an A ;-)). They brought us some creamed spinach and French fries. The French fries were absolute crunchy perfection. The steak was perfectly medium rare. It was a TON of food. We were so full, we didn't even have room for dessert...

221,2018-05-06,4.0,"If you're looking for the perfect location to impress on a first date, Boucherie is the place you want. The ambiance reminds me of a Parisian brasserie along the Seine, with the perfect amount of lighting for a dinner date. Candle lit, soft, and with a good soundtrack that's not too invasive but creates a lovely mood.From the appetizers to the desserts, you'll have plenty of choices, but there's a few items I'd recommend you to get - cause they're absolutely delicious. As an entree do not miss out on the French onion soup, it's such a staple and you'll love the cheesy top, the sweet and flavorful onion soup, and you'll end up dipping more bread into it as not to waste a single drop. The steak tartare is another one of my favorite: sometimes it can be a hit or a miss depending on who's seasoning it, but it will still be worth ordering. As per my last visit, my Tartare needed a bit more acidity and a tiny pinch of salt, but I'm literally nit picking here.For the entree: if you're on a splurge kind of night do not hesitate and get the tomahawk steak. It's a 40oz rib-eye, with roasted bone marrow and a delicious bordelaise. Accompany it with a side of fries and creamed spinach and you're golden! If you're more on of a first-date-not-sure-where-this-is-going-yet kinda night, maybe just go for the classic steak frites. Let's go to desserts - cause you can't go to a French restaurant and not have dessert. One of my absolute favorite is the creme brûlée: creamy, velvety, with a perfectly crunchy caramelized top. If you're into something a bit more indulgent do not miss out on the chocolate mousse or try the classic profiteroles (that come with a side of chocolate to drizzle on top). All in all, this is definitely a place I'd recommend to anyone, granted they're willing to spend a bit more than your usual restaurant. But the quality is excellent and everyone working there, from chef Jerome Dihui to everyone else, is absolutely amazing. Always polite, helpful, and very knowledgeable when it comes to the menu. So whether you're on a first date, or you're on you 100th one, Boucherie will most certainly not disappoint.",9.189285714285715,0.3484391534391533

My best friend couldn't return for the second trip so I had my sister step in her place and she was so impressed with the restaurant itself (decor, ambiance), the drinks, the steaks, dessert, and last but certainly not least--the service! I appreciated and was very thankful to the manager-Zorica V for taking the time and making the arrangements to make my second visit special. We were invited back and again -everything was fantastic. I tried a different drink this time (Boucherie Old Fashioned - highly recommended!) We had a delicious, fresh/light salad before our entree- I can't remember the name but I uploaded a picture so make sure you guys request this one. I had the Filet de boeuf filet with truffle butter  that was cooked perfectly. Dessert -Pistachio Bombe Glacee -GET IT! The entire staff was super attentive.

227,2018-05-02,5.0,"Wow. It's taken me awhile to think of how to describe this place and do it justice. My first visit to Boucherie was the union square location. That experience was phenomenal, but this one somehow goes even further in stunning me with impeccable food, ambiance, and service.Service: Sidy was our waiter, and he is a gem! He really goes above and beyond to ensure you're having an amazing meal. Ambiance: very French inspired and very cute. I like that this location is on the cozier side without feeling at all cramped. The decor features old French posters and trinkets. Food & drink: WOW. See below.- Wildflower cocktail: if you like fruity with a hint of absinthe, then this is for you. - Truffle mushroom ravioli. Just get it. This is a MUST-Eat.- Mussels: the sauce was delicious and I could eat it all day, but I wish the mussels were bigger. - Tomahawk ribeye for two: Out of this world! Beautifully presented and utterly delicious. Cooked to the perfect temp. This was my first time trying bone marrow and I really enjoyed it. - Pistachio ice cream with chocolate brownie: Yum. They pour some kind of heavenly chocolate sauce over the ice cream and brownie and it really completes the dish. - Creme brûlée: every restaurant these days seems to think they can do creme brûlée, but rarely have I tasted really good ones in the US. This one was very good, with a crunchy top and a light custard beneath, and I especially liked the fresh fruit on top.Overall, I couldn't recommend this place more! It's on the pricier side, but would be great for any kind of dinner - dates, friends, business, family.",2.3625,0.46886363636363637

229,2018-05-02,2.0,"OK, look, I'm French, from Paris, but I've lived in the US for a solid ten years. I'm not a particularly fussy eater nor snobby about French food. The atmosphere at Boucherie was nice, though the music didn't really match the decor. The food, on the other hand, was frankly mediocre. I had the duck confit as my main: A dry hunk of meat from an apparently malnourished animal. Duck confit is duck cooked in its own fat. The last thing it should be is dry. The potatoes that came with it were equally bad. Pommes de terre sarladaises should be scalloped and fried in duck fat, with a light crisp on the outside and soft in the middle. These were shaved so thin that, once fried, they literally turned into potato chips. How would you like a side of Lay's with your duck? The best part of the dish was the frisee lettuce, which says a lot, especially for a $35 dish. We also had a side of fries, which we didn't finish because, well, they weren't good either.For dessert, I had the creme brulee. The taste was good, but that's the easy part (anything with sugar and vanilla tastes good). The texture and the crust, on the other hand, were off. Creme brulee should be, well, creamy and smooth. The texture here was more crumbly, like that of a flan. If you get air bubbles in your creme brulee, something's gone wrong somewhere.  And the crust was too soft.In addition to the food being bad, both food and drinks are overpriced. $15 for a skimpy pour of bottom shelf French wine? Yeah, no, I don't think so.There are many, many French restaurants in the Village. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.",2.3625,0.13245614035087722

We had escargot and a calamari salad to start. As an entree I got the New York strip steak and my wife got the salmon both perfectly cooked and delicious. I don't really eat fish but I tried the salmon. Not going lie it was really good. For desert we shared a chocolate mousse. Everything was great I would definitely go back. Highly recommended.

With a well curated consistent menu of French classics, daily specials, butcher section of finely cooked meats, and a few rotating fresh seasonal dishes, there is something for everyone.Meat is definitely Boucherie's focus (hence the name), so any cut of beef you get will be high standard. However, they can do fish and vegetarian dishes equally well. Focus is on ingredients over salt or heavy seasoning, as well exemplified but the mushroom ravioli. Each mushrooms' different flavor comes through, enhanced by a truffle tinged sauce and al dente pasta cover. The bouillabaisse is one of their specialties and will please the seafood lovers! It's a tinge spicy and has a delicious base that covers huge chunks of lobster, jumbo shrimps, and lots more. The salade niçoise is fresh and a great compliment to heavier entrees or could make a great meal for one. Apparently their pistachio bombe glaçée is amazing because it was gone by the time we tried to order! However, the profiteroles are lovely and will please anyone as long as they don't hate chocolate.

I came here on a 7pm Wednesday and the crowd was not too crowded, not too empty. Our server, Sayed, was so attentive and amazing, I have nothing but kind words to say about him and made the evening go very smoothly. My date and I decided to go all out with apps, entree, dessert, and of course drinks! For drinks, we got Matterhorn, sezarac, Franco Mexican war, and coccinella. Drinks were not that strong, but definitely a good addition to the dinner. Everything was very flavorful and different. I highly recommend the Sezarac. I would honestly come back to the bar just for that. So. Good. For appetizers, we got salade nicoise and salade d'auvergne which were outstanding. I'm not kidding. I'm not even a huge salad person and these apps were so fresh and vibrant! Their vinaigrette is FIRE. Highly recommend. For entrees, my date and I don't eat red meat, but we still had quite a few options for fish and vegetarian dishes. We got Loup de mer (with branzine) and mushroom ravioli. Umm where to start?? I've never had branzine fish before but this dish changed my whole perspective. So fresh along with the veggies and fennel. Ravioli was bomb too. Portion size was perfect as well.We were stuffed at this point but the desserts were just too tempting! We got the creme brûlée and pistachio bombe glacee. Literally incredible.

If you are looking for a delicious dinner, in a fun part of the city, in a beautiful setting with attentive service then this is the place for you. We spent almost two hours sitting at a table outside and enjoyed every minute of it.Here is a list all of the drinks and menu items we had:DrinksFranco Mexican War - this was one of my favorites because I love smoky cocktails. It was smoky, a little bit sour and refreshing. Overall a nice mix of flavors as long as you like Mezcal.Bastille Sour - this drink was good and refreshing. I am a fan of Pisco sour and after spending time in Peru but I think I like the Bastille Sour a little bit better.Birds of Paradise - this was very sour. I wanted to stay on the sour track but if you prefer something sweet, I would choose something else.The Manhattan - this was my boyfriend's favorite as he always orders a Manhattan at every restaurant. The Manhattan at Boucherie was much larger than most other restaurants (always a plus) and it was not overly sweet like Manhattans elsewhere (also a plus). AppetizerRigatoni Bolognese - YUM. The rigatoni portion is enough for two to share. When we asked for recommendations, this was not one of them but we wanted it anyway. It should definitely be on the Rec list, it's delicious. The meat sauce was great and it was not overly salty. I would come back for this.Pomme frites - I love French fries. These were good and very crunchy. Nice to accompany the steak.MainsPorterhouse for 2 - wow this steak was amazing. It is on par with a Smith and Wollensky, Peter Luger and Delmonico type of quality steak. The marbling was perfect and it was cooked to perfection. It comes displayed nicely and the peppercorn sauce to accompany it is delicious as well as the creamed spinach. We were so happy we chose the porterhouse. Our server, Dragomir had suggested it and man was he right. DessertCrepe - it comes in an orange sauce with vanilla ice cream. I am a huge chocolate fan so I wish it was chocolate or Nutella with strawberries. HOWEVER, it was still delicious and slightly refreshing with the orange taste. Profiteroles - I got my chocolate fix here. It comes as a pastry with ice cream in the middle and chocolate all around as well as in top. The pastry was soft and the ice cream was delicious.Last but not least, the service. Our server was Dragomir and he was great. He was attentive and made sure we were comfortable and had what we need but he was not overly, annoyingly attentive. He was perfect and made excellent recommendations on drinks, the main course and dessert. We only hope he adds the bolognese to the list of recs.

239,2018-04-26,4.0,"Boucherie is a French brasserie in West Village, whose menu centers heavily around meat, as well as traditional French dishes like escargot and foie gras. I had stopped by this chic restaurant last year for a Yelp event, and had such a fantastic time that I decided to give them a try on a regular night.My friend and I arrived a few minutes after our reservation time. The seating hostess greeted us warmly and sat us down immediately. Our waiter walked over shortly and welcomed us to the restaurant. He kindly explained the menu and recommended some of the popular menu items. My friend and I tried the escargot as the appetizer. Drenched in a garlic-parsley butter, these delicacies were absolutely delicious and perfect to get us started for the feast to come. After that, we shared the 36 oz dry-aged tomahawk rib-eye. The steak was cooked perfectly and the portion was very generous. I loved the roasted bone marrow that came with the steak. The waitstaff made sure that we had plenty of bread to soak up this fatty goodness at all times. I really appreciate the restaurants that pay attention to small details like this, and it really made my dining experience special.The dining area is intimate, making it an ideal place for a romantic date night. In addition, the restaurant is quite spacious (a rare find in New York City) and therefore can easily accommodate large parties. I would absolutely recommend hosting your next holiday dinner party at this elegant yet trendy restaurant. From the impeccable service to delicious food, I would absolutely recommend Boucherie if you want to combine your love for steak with classic French dishes and wine.

240,2018-04-26,4.0,"I love Boucherie and had an amazing experience via Yelp recently at their other location near Union Square. The manager kindly reached out to some of us to have another sit down experience at the West Village location. The meal started off slow with gaining attention from the waiters but after about ten minutes of waiting things started to pick up. Cocktails here are always delicious. They have a decent happy hour called their 'green hour' which probably explains the crowd on a Monday. But a spread of their cocktails and wine are marked down to $10 until 7pm. I went with the Wildflower (St George Vert Absinthe, Hendrinks Gin, Watermelon Juice, Lavender Syrup, Lemon & Egg White) and my friend went with their Old Fashioned. My drink was so refreshing, delicious, and beautiful. Perfect for a sunny day with the windows open in the spring chilly air. Appetizers - We split the mussels and escargots. The mussels were great and the broth was delicious. They brought out complimentary bread to sop it all up with and marinated eggplant and sundried tomato to spread on. The escargot was a little too overdone. Nice and buttery and it comes out bubbling hot. By the time it was done simmering it just had this slightly too charred taste instead of melting away with the butter. Entrees - We both ordered two different kinds of steak. My friend has been here before so she guided me through the process. She went with the Steak Frites Au Poivre that comes with a delicious peppercorn gravy and I went with the filet de Boeuf that comes with wilted spinach. The quality of the meat is top notch. Unfortunately both of our steaks were really way over-cooked. We both ordered medium-rare but on the rarer side. My friend noted she wanted hers reddish-pink, definitely go more rare than medium. Both steaks came out on the grey-ish side. They still tasted phenomenal but if they were executed at the right temperature it would have been 5 stars good. The french fries were really delicious and crisp and we both loved that peppercorn cream sauce. Desert was a bit of a mishap with communications. They did bring out the desert menu too early before our steaks arrived but that's nitpicking away too much. We ordered the pistachio bomb glacee to split. Absolutely delicious. The ball of pistachio gelato is covered with a thick fudge layer of rich chocolate on top of a thin fudge brownie layer. The server pours this out onto the ball of ice cream. However, we asked if he could wait two seconds so my friend could adjust her camera settings and photograph him pouring it over slowly. He started to pour after she asked him to wait just a moment and then she asked him to stop and he started laughing and smiling at her while continuing to pour. It was a slightly weird moment. But I again enjoyed the ice cream even though an awesome photo opportunity went missed. All around there were pluses and minuses to the dining experience. I would definitely come back because I've had their meat cooked before at the right temperature and it's tasted divine; also their happy hour is really tempting in a beautiful environment.",8.740540540540538,0.2970953682019255

The white linen table cloth provide a nice touch (my mum is appalled when some nice restaurants forgo this simple touch that adds elegance to a dining experience so I always notice such detail).Now that the weather is warming up the al fresco seating will be perfect for people watching around the village while enjoying a nice glass of wine and a meal. It's like you're transported right to Paris.Service-Friendly, attentive, and accommodating. The smiling hostess immediately greeted us upon entering. Once seated, the server was attentive throughout.

Let me rephrase- free DELICIOUS bread. Perfect soft yet crusty with salted butter. Also, complimentary olives and mushrooms. YumThe MOUSSE DE FOIE GRAIS- locally sourced and delicious. The creamy texture and light taste were a nice way to start. The LOUP DE MER- branzino is one of my favorite fish however often served bone still in which prevents me from ordering it. Luckily the branzino here was filleted. Perfectly seared and flavorful.The FILET DE PORC ROTI- usually I'm not one to crave pork tenderloin however this Iberico cut immediately stood out to my friend and I. I think it was even my favorite of all the dishes even though they were all delicious. A large generous portion of meat, perfectly cooked Medium. The seasoning really complimented the meat. We shared a side of RATATOUILLE which went well with our entree choices.For dessert (don't judge, it was my friend's birthday and also my last night in the city for a while) we had the PISTACHIO BOMBE GLACEE. The presentation was beautiful. While I enjoyed the dessert I didn't get much pistachio flavor, possibly overpowered by the rich chocolate. We stuck with wine for our meal but there is a full bar.

The restaurant is on the expensive side, which to me is an important factor. I like to spend money on quality food, and I would say Boucherie provides great French food. However, there are comparable, dare I say better French restaurants in New York that will cost you much less. That is where my rating is lower than most because, you can get this quality food at Augustine in the Beekman hotel in lower manhattan or Dominique Bistro nearby in the West Village. Below are some comments on the food!We tried to order the fish at 7pm and they were already sold out, which was slightly frustrating, seeing as it was still early and this was what we were truly craving.Steak Frites- good portion size, cooked well. Delicious- approximately $45- slightly more expensive in comparison to others, not the best I have ever had.Demi glace steak- best thing at the table, it was cooked perfectly and Demi glace is honestly something that my father spends an entire day making drinking wine at home- I know the effort that goes into this and so this is a dish worth ordering. FLAVOR IS AMAZING.Burger- not worth the price, dry and you can find better burgers in New York.Ratatouille- served in a beautiful little dish and full of flavor.French Onion Soup- classic and savory- worth an order.Overall- good food, save your money and go elsewhere unless you are ordering the Demi glace steak!",-1.0916666666666666,0.3123742248742249

The elegant greenhouse aesthetic paired with the equally impressive service and food definitely make a perfect recipe for celebrating special occasions and on our way out, we even made a reservation for my father-in-law's upcoming birthday!For our dinner, my husband and I ordered:+ Saute de ris de veau aux morilles ($26) aka veal sweet breads and mushrooms galore - I'm not the most adventurous eater so I was hesitant to try sweet bread (thymus gland) but my husband wanted to try it and I'm obsessed with mushrooms. Honestly, I only had a little nibble of the sweet bread, which was actually very tame (no funny texture or taste), but I still mostly ate the mushrooms. However, we both decided this was our favorite dish of the night and we both loved the flavor and uniqueness of the dish!+ Moules mariniere ($23) aka mussels - We generally order mussels whenever and wherever it's offered as an appetizer. These were not particularly notable but still delicious. The broth was more flavorful than average but the mussel-plumpness was only average.+ Lotte rotie aux coques ($37) aka monkfish - I'd heard in the past that monkfish was a ""poor man's lobster"" and although I'd had it before, I never quite understood the comparison until Boucherie. This was truly a delicious dish--the broth was so flavorful (I found it surprisingly familiar and reminded me of Chinese cuisine a little) and the monkfish was akin to a very tender lobster!+ Filet de boeuf ($52) aka filet mignon with truffle butter - I ordered it per the chef's recommendation--medium--and it was cooked perfectly. + Creme brulee - Actually, this might've been my favorite dish of the night. It was literally the most perfect creme brulee I've ever had. The caramelized top was strong enough that when we tapped it gently it didn't break, but when we actually dug in, it was so delicate tasting--how did they do that? The inside was also perfection and chock fill of tiny vanilla bean dots (is there a technical term for the dots?) and the berries were the perfect complement.There are so many things on the menu that I can't wait to try and I'm sure I'll have many dishes to update this review with after we dine here for my father-in-law's birthday!",-5.2124999999999995,0.31970562770562766

The 40 oz steak with bone marrow--- Holy cow(pun attended) this is amazing. I've never had such an elaborate steak which included the bone marrow and a huge t-Rex like bone.  The meat was flavorful and juicy and was accompanied by an array of delicious sauces. We also ordered the cream brûlée and profiteroles. Both were great ending to a meal.

The big glamorous Xmas tree in the center of the restaurant was a plus. Food and service were wonderful. My second experience at Boucherie was the Yelp Elite event hosted at the Park location. It was also a wonderful experience.  We were able to try all kinds of dishes that night and unlimited wine. I received an email from the manager and was invited to a complementary dinner of two at the West Village location. If the place was not great to start with, I wouldn't want to waste time on it even its complementary. I brought my mom here for an early Wed dinner. This time I had the chance to see the restaurant with plenty of light.We were seated on the second floor where the space is more private and overseeing the restaurant. There's a cute sunroof on top of the restaurant. I love the ambience here. It's cozy and glamorous at the same time. We ordered escargot and scallops as appetizers. Both were prepared perfectly. The scallops were so tender. Escargots were fresh and seasoned nicely.  My mom and I both got rack of lambs in medium rare. They were definitely the right decisions. Not everyone likes lambs but they did it well. We finished the meals with creme brûlée. Perfect ending. Overall all the 3 experiences at Boucherie were amazing. Highly recommended. The West Village location is perfect for a date night. Ask for second or third floor seats for more quiet and private atmosphere.

In my experience, if you've tried one great french restaurant, you've tried them all. This honestly goes for Boucherie as well, however, that doesnt make it any less delicious. The charcuterie (not pictured as we inhaled it) was fresh and so tasty, and they kept the bread refills coming - important!! I was prepping for a half marathon the next day and told our server to not stop with the bread and he more than listened LOL.My steak sandwich was also yummy, cooked perfectly and the hollandaise sauce wasnt overwhelming. The creme brulee was the star of the show.

We started our feast off with a cocktail (forget the name but it was amazing and had egg whites and hints of orange). Our waiter was very attentive and had excellent recommendations (we pretty much just had him order). For starters we had the Caesar salad and the mussels. The salad was very fresh and was a great lighth start to the meal and the mussels brought me back to when I visited Bruges. I don't think I left one drop of that buttery sauce un-absorbed by bread, I would definitely recommend the mussels and maybe next time I'll ask for the sauce to go. For the entree we decided to go big or go home so we got the 36 oz Pat LaFrieda to share and I think I saw God in each bite--by far the best steak we've eaten. We ended the night with creme brûlée, one of my favorite desserts. I had high expectations because I just recently got back from Paris and had this at almost every dinner and wow Boucherie did not disappoint. It was creamy, rich, and had the perfect sugar crust. Overall, the service was top notch, we always felt like we were being taken care of and our waiters suggestions were spot on. The ambience is a nice balance of high end and comfortable.

I had tried this place before during a Yelp Elite event in 2017 and they were kind enough to invite me back. Started with some appetizerssteak tartare - it's a unique take on the normal tartare. Not in the shape of a brick, but spread out rather very thinly. mussels - omg, there were so many mussles in this appetizer alone. The sauce was flavorful and absolutely delectable. This dish is amazing price to value ratio and I'd highly recommend it. Main course scallop - oh so soft, but sadly only comes with 3 pieces. Perfectly cooked so the outside and inside have even consistency. Perfectly flavored, the taste of scallop was very apparent and not masked by the sauce.  center-cut filet mignon for 2 - absolutely massive portion size and comes with a sizeable amount of bone marrow as well. It originally came out room temp and didn't taste quite as good as I thought it could have. We sent it back and it returned much hotter so much tastier. I didn't really enjoy the charred pieces on the end so skipped that but the middle pieces were a perfect medium rare, not too chewy and still bloody. Bone marrow was very rich and difficult to finish. Might have been good to mix the meat with the bone marrow. Dessertpistachio bombe glacee - unique presentation. Chocolate easily overpowers the pistachio so eat the pistachio ice cream alone if you want that flavor. I actually preferred eating each part separately.Service was fantastic. Extremely attentive, constantly refilled our waters, and cleared all the dirty plates.

While we waited for our meals they served fresh made bread and salted butter (with orange?) which was excellent. I had the fillet while my wife enjoyed the salmon with sides of cream of spinach and mushrooms. Everything on our table was excellent. My fillet was a healthy sized cut of meat that was perfectly seasoned and cooked with a slice of truffled butter on top. My wife's salmon came with lentils that were a nice touch to bring out the medium cooked fish. The mushrooms and spinach worth the price of admission. Also of note, they have an Absinth drip that I will explore on a future visit. This is not an inexpensive restaurant but I felt that the experience and quality of food was worth the price.

We started with the Soupe à l'Oignon and the Escargots; all of it was beautifully prepared and delicious. I was truly reminded of the little cafes I've been to in Paris, and that's saying a lot. For the main course we ordered the Saint Jacques a la Provençale (scallops), Poulet Grand Mere (chicken), and Salade de Fruits de Mer (seafood salad with a kick!). The scallops were seared perfectly; not chewy, felt like cutting through warm butter (as it should be). The chicken was delicious, but a tad dry with the yukons being overcooked as well -- this is why I gave the 4 stars and not 5; hopefully it was just a mistake that evening. The seafood salad with a kick was full of different flavor profiles, which I appreciated. The fennel and grapefruit are a nice touch to an otherwise typically bland salad. Enjoy!",-8.225,0.18349358974358973
286,2018-03-21,5.0,"I wanted to post an update to this review to be fair: Following my previous disappointing experience here, the manager reached out and was very apologetic. She listened to my concerns and extended an invitation to come back to try Boucherie again. I really appreciated it - that was already much better service than what I experienced the first time there.I came back recently with my sister after a long work week. This time, service definitely stood out as excellent. We were accommodated in the main dining room at a round marble top facing the bar. We got a nice view of the restaurant while not being stuck in amidst restaurant traffic. Foodwise, we started off with a pair of French onion soups and shared a fennel-citrus salad from their seasonal menu. Both items were on point. For some reason, a lot of restaurants seem to mess up French onion soup, but I can safely say that Boucherie is one of the restaurants that make it properly - with very flavorful broth, sliced artisan bread, topped with a nice cheesy crust. The fennel salad was lightly dressed, refreshing, and nicely portioned. For our main dishes, we got the filet mignon and steak-frites. The filet had a much better texture this time - it was perfectly cooked and I would definitely recommend it as a go-to option if you don't know what else to pick. I don't recall the cut for the steak-frites, but it was definitely well-sized and came with a peppercorn sauce on the side. (I'm actually glad that the sauce was included on the side, as the peppercorn flavor is pretty strong. I would also recommend to order this steak medium rare.) What I really liked about these dishes is that unlike other restaurants, nothing is overly salty, so I did not feel the need to drink tons of water. My sister and I ended the meal with a crème brûlée, which comes topped with fresh slices of strawberries. Although it was decently sized (and we were quite full), this crème brûlée was very light and not too sweet. It had a very nice texture, both in the custard and the sugar crust. I'm definitely glad we went with the crème brûlée. Overall, props to the restaurant for caring about customer concerns in a city where there is no shortage of other customers. The restaurant itself is beautiful and pretty easy to get to. I'm definitely keeping it on the docket for future dining experiences - brunch or dinner.",-2.140677966101695,0.25499999999999995

Because I paid $22 for avocado toast thinking it would be worth the premium given the restaurant, but it wasn't. It was plain avocado toast. Nothing special. I got fancier avocado toasts before at the deli that was $7 but the staff and drinks were impeccable. I guess maybe it was my own fault for ordering that at a restaurant like that, but I was just expecting more lavishness when I pay $22 for avocado toast.

We enjoyed all of the recommendations given to us... our server was attentive and wasn't shy about refilling our bread!  The space itself is spacious but somehow simultaneously cozy and warm.  I had visited previously in December, and their Christmas tree display was phenomenal.  We started the meal with the mussels and caesar salad.  The salad had just the right amount of cheese, the the mussels were stacked high.  Warning: the mussels also contain pieces of sausage, for you pescatarians our there.  If you're only getting one app, get the mussels.  For my entree I got the Monday special, 2 whole whopping pounds of lobster.  What a great reason for a Monday night out!  I was able to finish, but needed help with the fries that came piled on the side.  With two glasses of wine down the hatch, I just *barely* had enough room to split a dessert. The profiteroles were refreshing and didn't weigh us down.  The crime brûlée also sounded amazing though, it was the toughest choice of the night.I'm excited to try Boucherie's new location!

Both times we were treated very generously. I'm normally not a meat eater, but one of the chefs offered me scallops even after the event officially concluded in December, which totally made my night. When we returned in January for a proper sit-down dinner, we received excellent service, as expected. We were treated to a three-course meal with wine pairings. Although the food, presentation, and of course service were stellar, I didn't really love the wine recommendations. Understandably, I couldn't exactly hold the server to the standards of a sommelier. Besides that, my mom said her steak was a little burned and wasn't as good as what we'd had a few weeks prior. Except these small hiccups, we very much enjoyed our dinner.The ambiance at the restaurant is very cozy, which I like, though it can get a little crowded.

Every time I have been to Boucherie, their staff have been incredible.The ambiance is beautiful and is one of the few restaurants in NYC that doesn't feel small or cramped. It's large, specious, and beautifully decorated. My first visit to Boucherie was during the holidays, and they had an enormous, beautiful tree. It made the event really feel very festive.The drinks here are wonderful. I have been very into aperol lately, and they incorporate it into quite a few refreshing cocktails. I find their drinks to be perfectly balanced and not too sweet.Our waiter Sidy did a wonderful job at explaining the menu and helping us make decisions. Even Emil, the manager, came by to greet us. For dinner we started with the mussels and mushrooms in cream with brioche. Both delicious. The mushrooms were AMAZING. If you like mushrooms, cream, and bread... you'll love this. I've been dreaming of it since it left my mouth 7 days ago.For my entree, I chose the cod. It was recommended as a delicious staple and a healthy dish. I LOVED it. A perfectly cooked, beautiful piece of fish. They had diced vegetables on top that added a great texture. My friend had the veal ribeye special-- definitely a special piece of meat, really delicious (and huge!)The French fries need their own paragraph. The best French fries in the city? Yes. Perfectly golden, crispy, and fresh? Yes. If you like fries (you do) come eat them here, you'll shed tears.Ooh, the dessert. We had the brownie with pistachio ice cream drowned in dark chocolate.

I was given a wonderful cocktail recommendation (the strawberry rose' cocktail) which was delightfully refreshing! My friend and I ordered the mussels and the mushroom toast. The broth the mussels was in was divine and it was a great portion size. My main course was the veal steak special with mushrooms and sweetbreads.

292,2018-03-18,1.0,"Last night my friend and I were celebrating her birthday at the Boucherie located in the West Village. The decor was beautiful and the food was amazing, but the service was far from being amazing.   We felt rushed because everytime the appetizer, entree or dessert came out, immediately soon afterwards( several times) the server and the waiter would ask, "" Are you done?"" in a rude tone. When I was trying to whisper to the waiter without being obvious to my friend that it was her bday, the waiter just again rushed me and was rude about it.  I was not aware that there was any time limit to our dining experience. When the server came to us again with an attitude asking, "" Are you finished?"", we responded that we were still working on the dessert( the dessert was not even half done) and to our dismay, we were shocked to witness the server making a face about us to the waiter. How is this kind of treatment and behavior acceptable towards anyone?, especially on a day where it was supposed to be a celebration. This is not a good representation of Boucherie. I hope that no one else will experience a dining experience here like we did.  People need to be treated with respect no matter who they are, the minute they enter the restaurant. You can have the most amazing food, but if the service is not up to par, it definitely ruins the whole dining experience.

The onion compote in the red wine sauce really complimented the texture of the mousse. Scallops was insanely flavorful! For our main we had "" Cote de boeuf"" and it was amazing, so delicious! Perfectly cooked medium. The bone marrow on top was delight. The steak frites was delicious. The steak was tender and dense, as a result of the aging. The peppercorn sauce had good body but the flavor was a bit on the milder side  and the most amazing fries. Crispy on the outside, with little specks of crunchy fried goodness!

294,2018-03-17,5.0,"The last time I was here, I was here for the fabulous Yelp Elite event during Christmas (thank you for hosting Yelp & Boucherie!) and their Christmas tree was beautiful!Obviously, the Christmas tree is gone now but I have to say--though it's less festive looking, the restaurant still has a nice and warm glow that give you the feeling of warmth. Surely, that's due to the decor and ambiance, so huge kudos to you for that, Boucherie!So let's see.. this time I had the Birds of Paradise and Negroni cocktail (again, please get the Negroni, it's so goooood). The bartender who made my drinks is named Nenord (hope I didn't misspell his name whiach I feel like I did.. I'm sorry). But he makes super yummy cocktails and he gave me a really good and accurate description of Birds of Paradise. It's really earthy but yummy, so don't let the beets in it stop you!For dinner, I shared mussels with my friend and the mussels were delicious.. for one thing- I find it kind of hard to find a restaurant that really knows how to make both meat and seafood delicious. I find that usually well known steakhouses/steak focused restaurants don't usually make seafood great, not even decent; which I don't think it's a big deal because they're known of steak but wow kudos to you for making it happen, Boucherie! So there's that. Hands down I recommend the mussels.Instead of ordering steak, I went adventurous and pasta mood--so I went for their Ravioli aux Champignons which has truffles ahhh! If you follow me and my reviews, I think you know how I feel about truffles by now right? Like literally l o v e . The black truffle was used in a perfect amount where it wasn't overwhelming and you can still taste the mushrooms that are in it. Ugh. Hands down, one of the best raviolis I've had in my life.Finally for dessert--We had their Pistachio ice cream with chocolate poured over it.. They poured the chocolate onto the ice cream in front of you and it was such a fascinating experience. This just intensifies your craving for their dessert. Absolutely love that idea of how they do that.Overall, I must say--Boucherie does not disappoint. I was once again amazed by them. I had a great dining experience though it wasn't a Yelp event. They are absolutely a top restaurant in New York for me. I only wish that I live or work around the area so I can go all the time, that would make my life so much better. It's a great restaurant to go to after work for a drink, have a date, or even to dine with a friend like I did. I 100% highly recommend you to go there and try all their food. I would absolutely recommend you to try their steak if it's your first time. Especially their Tomahawk steak and bone marrow, like omg, it is a life changing experience and your mouth and stomach will appreciate you for doing that. Otherwise, I have nothing more to say until the next time I come here.Absolutely will be back here soon for drinks and food :)",-11.125,0.30314660894660894

Mrs.Zorica V. the manager, noticed my first review, then personally messaged me to apologize and invite me back for a complimentary dinner. I initially asked for a reservation on thursday, but something came up last minute so I had to cancel. Mrs.Zorica was more than happy to change my reservation to Friday night instead. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted warmly and then seated right away.Our server was a friendly blonde lady with a nice, soft accent. She greeted us as soon as we sat down, and then shortly brought us our drinks that we ordered. ( They were strong ! , but I'm not complaining )We ordered the Beef Tartare for appetizer.

302,2018-03-13,5.0,"We're only a fourth of the way through the year, but I can honestly say that Boucherie is on the short list for the best meal I've had in 2018.Hell, it might be one of the best meals I've ever had in NYC!Boucherie was kind enough to invite us to their restaurant for a Yelp Holiday party in 2017 (https://www.yelp.com/biz/yelp-elite-event-boucherie-new-york?hrid=nfOPVKk3sj8b7mVUVe2ILg), so I knew the quality of food and service were going to be top notch, but they went above and beyond. Zorica (the manager) extended an invitation for us to return, and the timing was perfect (for full transparency, they covered everything except for our wine and gratuity).I had a friend in town who was hankering for a steak, and I was lucky enough to snag a weeknight table for dinner. Boucherie is really three different levels - there's the floor with a bar, a ton of half-booths, and a really long table for larger parties. Then there's the private second floor with the wine room. And in between is a split-level elevated area that makes you feel like royalty. Or at least, like you're one of those VIPs at a concert. Great for people watching.Before our waiter Andres came by to take our orders, we were pretty set on our starters. But then he confirmed that what we wanted were house favorites, so of course we had to get them. They were the escargots de Bourgogne and the foie gras stuffed quail. Yeah, let that sink in. Foie gras. Stuffed. Quail.We started out with the escargot, which were large and meaty, in a wonderful buttery parsley sauce served in a traditional escargot dish. Each one of the snail slots had 2-3 pieces in them, so it was actually quite a lot to share (but we finished them all... then dipped our bread in the butter sauce).Definitely started the meal out on a high, and then the stuffed quail arrived and blew all of our expectations out of the water. I'm not exaggerating when I say this is one of the BEST dishes I've ever had. It was a whole quail that our waiter cut in half in front of us. Inside was an insane amount of foie gras. And the bird was resting atop a bed of spinach in a balsamic glaze that was also evenly distributed on our plates. Everything about the quail was perfect. The skin was thin and crispy. The tiny little drumstick had just a little more exposure to heat on it, giving it a nice char. And of course, the Hudson Valley foie gras was great. Rich, but not overwhelming. A 5 star dish, for sure. And a steal at only $26!!For our main, we decided to go big with the Chateaubriand pour deux. I just have to say for the record that Boucherie is very liberal with their definition of ""for two"" because what we got could've fed a family of five.It was a center-cut filet mignon with a bone marrow bordelaise sauce and vegetables. The whole thing was served in an actual skillet with the marrow bone underneath the perfectly medium rare steak. The steak was amazing - touched with just the right amount of fire (one of the things I love most about Boucherie is they actually have a flame grill). Not going to lie - I forgot about most of the veggies, but I remember asparagus and perhaps some squash. Vegetables were the last thing on my mind as the two of us were determined to finish the meat.For dessert, we split the pistachio bombe glacee. It wasn't quite ice cream, but all the constituent parts worked together to give off the illusion that it was. The base was more or less a really cold brownie (which was somehow still chewy!), then a big ball of pistachio mousse. When it was brought to our table, a waiter poured chocolate all over the confection in order to give it its signature cannonball look. And holy crap, enough words cannot be said about how amazing it was (I sound like a broken record, I know). Every bite was perfect and it was decadent as heck. But the airy mousse made it not dense. Paired very well with a Gran Marnier as a digestif.I almost forgot to mention the drinks! They have a great bar program. I'd previously had their wonderful tequila old fashioned before, so opted for something a little different this time - the Matterhorn, an absinthe cocktail with passionfruit and apricot. Crisp and balanced. I love absinthe cocktails, but only when they're done right. And Boucherie does 'em right.We also ordered a bottle of wine, and the sommelier came over to review our choice with us, which was very much appreciated.If I could give a million stars to Andres and the rest of the staff for their hospitality, I would. The recommendations we received were spot-on. We had our cutlery replaced after ever course. Our water glasses were never more than half empty (or, depending on your outlook, half full). And at the end of our meal, Zorica personally made sure to find me and to thank us for coming in. But really, I'm the one who should be thanking her and Boucherie for a first-rate dining experience!I have (and will continue to) tell everyone who will listen about how good that quail was...",-1.553191489361702,0.20697671376242802

The pate was smooth and spread well on the toasted bread. The star of the meal was the cote de boeuf with bone marrow. It was phenomenal. The beef literally melted in my mouth and the bone marrow made it even more luscious. It could be a bit decadent for some people - just pair it with some wine. The dish wasn't plated as well than some of the pictures I saw on Yelp. Finally, it was time for the creme brûlée and I was already stuffed!

The menu is French, through-and-through. My friend got Steak Frites and it (seriously) changed his mood. He came to the restaurant in kind of a sour mood (tough week). But by the time he was done with his dinner, he couldn't stop saying how good his entree was. His custom Old Fashioned cocktail (recommended by our server) may have also contributed to that.  I went with classic Duck Confit (paired with a glass of red wine which they let me sample before I got a full glass). My dinner was delicious; the duck was crispy and the greens + potatoes were a great complement. To end the night, I ordered a mug of chocolate mousse and it was lovely. The reason I don't give this a full 5 stars is that there were some miscommunications between the servers. We ordered our drinks from our server and then, a few minutes later, somebody came by asking to take our drinks (which made us worried our original drink orders didn't get in).

From the very beginning of our time there, we were met with incredible service from the staff who met us with a smile and made us feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant (although the place was full by the time we left!) We started our dinner with an order of mussels and scallops. The scallops were my favorite! Savory and cooked to perfection. My fiancé immediately devoured the mussels (huge mussels fan) and was beyond happy with the large plate. They do not skimp out on quantity or quality here. For our entrees, we both ordered steaks. I ordered the filet de boeuf and my fiancé ordered the faux filet de barcy. We were both in awe when our food came out so beautifully prepared and cooked to the perfect temperatures. I would highly recommend the filet de boeuf as the truffle butter that comes with the steak is the perfect accompaniment. The flavor leaked into the tender meat and provided one of the most unforgettable culinary experiences in my life. We ended dinner sharing the profiteroles for dessert. It was light and a unique blend of vanilla and chocolate that made our bellies a bit heavier and satisfied on our way out. I urge anyone in the area to check Boucherie out if you want an amazing dining experience that capsulates Joie de vivre. You won't regret it!",-2.9699999999999998,0.39336309523809526

All the dishes were tasty but they all felt like they could just use a tad of a tweak.We had the tartar. It was good but I wish it had a little less mustard. It was overpowering even though it was good mustard...def not frenchs yellow mustard. The French onion soup was good. The asparagus with cheese and proscuitte was the best and tastiest. However because of how it came, it was a little awkward to eat. I almost wish it had a vehicle so that I could put everything together in one bite...or perhaps cut differently. When I did manage to get it together, the dish was very tasty and well balanced. The pineapples were a nice surprise that really balanced out the flavours of the dish.The tomahawk was great. The cook was perfect on my order. I just wish there was a tad more of that sauce they serve it with and I wish it could have been served with a side of something to cut the meat. For the price, I think I'd rather go to Peter lugers when the L train is fixed.The fries were the biggest disappointment. French restaurants usually have great fresh fries. But I'm pretty sure boucherie's fries were pre-frozen. The outside was crispy thanks to a coating of potato starch, but the inside was mush. This usually happens to fries that are frozen because during the cooking process the ice crystals melt and boil the inside of the fries, almost turning it into a baked potato feel. the outside gets crispy from the hot oil, forming a skin. It didn't have the bite and crunch that non frozen fries have. They reminded me of burger king fries. Not great. It's weird since fresh fries aren't expensive to do...not that much more expensive than frozen but much better in texture and taste. It's weird that this was where the skimping happened.Overall, I'd come back if I was in the area and was in the mood for a fancier dinner...but I wouldn't make a special trip.",0.04642857142857142,0.1742153679653679

As good as it was (the waiter actually preferred this over the foie gras), there was nothing too spectacular about it. I also ordered the duck confit, which was quite good - crispy skin and moist meat.

I didn't mean that in a bad way even though people will take it so. Nice, romantic vibes overall.FOOD:Ravioli was superb and rich. Strip steak was SMOKEY! Wow. It tasted like a peated whiskey in a steak. Pair it with their old-fashioned if you want a sweet peated cocktail alongside. The lamb was my favorite. The mustard provided a nice spicy tartness and the meat was oohhhh so tender. Crepes suzette with a port was a perfect end to the meal.

322,2018-02-27,5.0,"[OVERALL]Walking into the restaurant, you notice the well-planned décor and ambient dim lighting. The atmosphere gives off an upscale vibe, and the chatter of patrons fills the restaurant with liveliness. Our waiter was incredibly polite and was prompt throughout service (which lasted about 2 hours for a 3-course dinner) filling water and checking up on us. If you dine here, don't do so in a rush. The atmosphere is great for conversation with your partner, and you can enjoy the good food at a relaxed pace that is very French.[FOOD]Raviolis aux Champignons - Let's start with the sauce: amazingly creamy with a tasteful touch of truffle. The ravioli itself wasn't too heavy, and the mushrooms were both fragrant and flavorful. I would have loved another dimension of flavor (either from something sweet or herby). A very nice appetizer to share among 2-3 people.Faux-Filet Bercy - We ordered medium-rare, and the strip came out beautifully. The crust added a nice smokiness to the tender meat. The portion size is quite big; I suggest sharing a few pieces with your dining companion!Côtelettes d'Agneau Romarin - This is what I was immediately drawn to when reading the menu. The lamb came out cooked perfectly with that amazing lamb taste. The balsamic glaze paired with the mustard added an interesting dimension of flavor that really elevated the dish (if they added mustard seeds to the crust, this would be a dish that would be 12/10). The vegetables were cooked AMAZINGLY - full of flavor and complementing each other and the meat perfectly. The potatoes in particular were flavorful, with slight sweetness. Pommes Frites - Everyone craves fries. If you are, indulge yourself by ordering pommes frites on the side. They were crisp and seasoned very well. Crêpes Suzette - Basically the crêpe version of a Dreamsicle. Was so pleasant to eat and a great way to lightly end the meal. Not too sweet, but definitely delicious. [DISCLAIMER]I was invited by Zorica the manager to a complimentary meal; however, all statements made in this review are truthful and from my own personal experience. Zorica was incredibly hospitable and personally came over to greet me. I would definitely recommend coming to Boucherie for an upscale French meal!",-5.629166666666666,0.4097083333333333

There's a ground floor, balcony floor, and second floor. The very high ceilings make for a large and grand atmosphere but it still feels very cozy with the open kitchen and large bar and plant decor.The service was meh. I was a bit disappointed. I know my waiter said he was new but we didn't get our order taken until maybe about 15-20 minutes of waiting. Because of how our table was set up, waiters kept bumping into our table, shifting our tablecloth, and almost knocking over things on our table to get to another table. All in all a weird experience that made me wish that table overlooking the balcony just didn't exist. That being said, the service was very attentive once we started eating and always checked up on us.The food though is definitely 5 stars. I had the escargot for an appetizer and the duck confit for my entree. The escargot was great - you get a huge portion and it is flavorful. The duck confit with the endive was amaaaazing.

The medium rare were all just pink inside and the medium was basically thoroughly cooked. The portions were very worthwhile for the price but the overcooking really dropped the stars.

I've now been at different times of the week and at different times in the evening. The first time I went was an early Tuesday evening when there weren't as many people, so I thought the service was exceptional because of that. This time, I went at a much busier time, and we had no fewer than five different people check on us to make sure we enjoyed our food and our dining experience. The tomahawk for two does not fail to amaze. It is a bit pricey, but you can tell the quality of the meat is great and the precision it takes to cook it perfectly is also evident each time. The creamed spinach is a must with any large portion of delicious meat, and theirs does not fail to meet expectations. Not too greasy or heavy and pairs so well with the meat. As for appetizers, I've only had the foie gras here, but it has a wonderful flavor and is a real treat each time I have it. As for the desserts, I've had the creme brûlée, which is perfectly crispy on top and so wonderfully decadent without being too heavy.

Great lighting and decor, and very open and spacious.The wait staff was also very attentive and helpful the entire time.  They provided water refills regularly and were readily available to answer questions about food, and made some nice recommendations.While we were thinking about what we'd order, they brought a bread basket, butter, and a small antipasto plate, which was unexpected.  And we were a bit speedy eating the bread, and they brought us another basket; also unexpected and nice.We started our meal with the Toast Aux Champignons, which is mushrooms in a creamy sauce with a couple pieces of toast.  The sauce was amazing. My fiance and I kept commenting on how good it was!For entrees, I had the Cabbilaud Roti, a seared cod dish.  The presentation was gorgeous, and the carrot puree was quite good.  The fish was cooked perfectly and was a nice piece of fish, but it didn't really blow my mind in the way the appetizer did.

339,2018-02-19,5.0,"This is an update from my last review. After my last review, the manager directly reached out to me to apologize and offered us a complimentary dinner. When we arrived, we were pleasantly welcomed by the Manager, Zorica. She once again apologized for our previous experience and made absolutely certain that we had a pleasant experience. We ordered the Caille Farcie (stuffed quail with foie gras) as our appetizer. The presentation was very exquisite; it had a nice wow factor when the server initially cut it open. The taste of the foie gras unfortunately wasn't too strong but it was smooth and paired exceptionally well with the quail. For entrees, I got the rack of lamb and my boyfriend got the 16oz dry-aged New York strip. They both came out medium rare and in good portions. The rack of lamb was tender, not gamy, and paired well with the dijon mustard. The steak was tender inside  and crispy outside. For dessert, we ordered the pistachio bombe glaciee and the profiteroles. Our server brought out a cup of chocolate and poured into the pistachio bombe glaciee in front of us; what a lovely presentation! :) However, the pistachio wasn't strong enough for my taste. During both of our visits, the servers were immensely polite, attentive and professional. We enjoyed our second visit significantly more than the first one. We are already planning a return visit to Boucherie; this time with friends. ____________________________I was disappointed by the way that they treat their customers. I made a reservation for 4 people for my boyfriend's birthday, and unfortunately 2 of my friends were late due to an accident. I ordered 2 cocktails and 2 appetizers while we waited. After an hour, the waiter came by and asked politely if our friends were still coming. He said that they will have to move us to another table if they were not coming; I then told him that our friends were on their way. Then another 15 mins passed by, the maitre d' stopped by and said the same thing. However, her attitude was pushy and her tone was demeaning; she told us that we could only have the table for another 45 mins. How were we supposed to order our entrees, dessert and finish it within 45mins? When I initially made the reservation, it did not mention the time limit, and it was not mentioned when we arrived at the restaurant and told them that we were waiting for our friends. Plus, when we looked around, there were tons of empty tables around us. It just made us felt rushed and not welcomed. Despite the fact that our friends were only a block away, we decided to get the check and leave after the maitre d' spoke to us. I expect a reception like this from a hole-in-the-wall, not from a $$$ French restaurant on my boyfriend's birthday (that they were aware of). The cocktails were far toosweet for our taste; especially their Old Fashioned. The food and service from our waiter was great, but the way that they allocate their tables and maitre'd's hospitality is horrific!

Food was excellent, except for the creme brulee which tasted delicious but was very runny. It clearly had not had enough time to set. The reason I'm taking a star off happened when we first arrived with a reservation mind you I had made weeks in advance. The hostess takes us upstairs and seats us at the worst table in the room. So small and cramped I couldn't even turn to look at my date. It was also right next to the staircase and water filling station which meant that we would have been constantly interrupted during the night if I had not complained and asked to move to a better table, which the hostess had no problem doing btw because the entire upstairs was EMPTY when we arrived. Seating guests at terrible tables when your restaurant ins't even full, especially those that have had reservations is by far my number one pet peeve from dinning experiences over the years and put a slight damper on the evenings mood at the beginning.

Came here for Valentine's Day and had one of the worst meals I've ever had in the city. It began with the hostess practically racing up to the table, not waiting for us to go up the two small sets of stairs. Here is a tip: If you get seated upstairs, ask to be seated downstairs. Upstairs, you feel every footstep of every person that walks on the rickety ""floor""... shaking everything on the table. The bread was inedible... we were served two end pieces and a middle slice... all dry and several days past ""baguette"" status. I ordered the Wednesday special and my girlfriend ordered the hanger steak. The special, Coq au Vin ($36), was a drum stick and two small bone-in chicken breasts in a red wine sauce. Very little meat and for $36 The hanger steak was just... bad. It was charred on the outside, bitter when you ate it, and inside was cooked just alright. We sent it back. It came back less charred, but extremely undercooked on the inside. No one checked on us. Meanwhile, we heard our waiter explaining to the table two tables over, who also sent back their steak (!) that this was due to them not using gas but a wood or direct heat to cook the steak. We didn't eat the steak, told the bus boy not to take it back when he took the chicken. He took the plate anyway. Waiter came, we said clearly we don't wait dessert, and didn't want to pay for the steak. He insisted on dessert on the house, over  our denials, until we gave in due to his pressure. The dessert, the creme brulee, was excellent. The check came and the steak was on the bill. Come on. This meal took ALL of the fun out of Valentines Day. The service was what put the icing on the cake; long delays for everything and no one checked in on our meals (we had to flag down the waiter to complain initially and no one checked on us after our new steak came). You can certainly do better in this part of town.",-2.973333333333333,-0.06273716898716895

The space is bright and warm and lively. So lively in fact, a few tables down from us was Blake Lively... but I digress. While this place specializes in French style steaks, we opted for a few other dishes, both traditional French fare, and otherwise. We started with the escargots and the mushroom ravioli. If you've never had escargot, or are an escargot fan, this is the place to get them. A sizzling plate arrives with half a dozen plump snails, swimming in rich, melty butter. These are so creamy and tender I'd almost think these snails were fed nothing but butter and cream before showing up on the plate. The mushroom ravioli, six plump half moon pillows of deliciousness show up in a light, buttery, creamy, mushroomy, truffley sauce. It's a must for lovers of mushrooms. I'm a sucker for skate and if I see it in a menu, I'm ordering it. The skate wing here is totally decedent. You get a very large skate wing, perfectly sautéed and bathed in brown butter. The skate flakes apart and takes more like tender crab soaked in butter than fish. It's excellent. For no particular reason, a burger sounded really, really good here. Good call on our part. The burger here is truly a gourmet burger, and you can taste the quality of the Pat LaFrirda beef, and it pairs perfectly with the caramelized onions and melty gruyere. To finish up the meal, we had some profiteroles and tarte tatin. Both desserts were perfectly executed. Great meal here at Boucherie. For all you Francophiles out there, or lovers of butter, this place is for you. You'll not be disappointed.",-3.6666666666666674,0.25604256854256857

344,2018-02-15,2.0,"2018 Feb. NYC Restaurant Week DinnerI cam here w/ my wife during 2018 Feb. NYC Restaurant week dinner. I have a mixed feeling about this place. Decor and ambient were not as good as it is seen on some of the pictures in Yelp. Also, overall waiting staffs were not well trained. However, food was great. Decor and ambientMy wife and I were lead to front of restaurant where there were many tables clustered together like you see in cafeteria. There was no privacy as the area was wide open and waiting staffs were standing very close to our table on the window side of restaurant. There were cozy and a little more private spots in the back and 2nd floor but we were seated in wide open area. The bar and open kitchen area looked good especially the oversize copper color hood in the kitchen. But seating area in front of restaurant was not great.ServiceApparently, there was a new waiting staff and they were training the new person so taking order was a bit challenge. We ordered sparkling water so the waiting staff poured the sparkling water and then they took the bottle to somewhere (why?) so other waiting staff couldn't see that we were drinking sparkling water. Because of this, other waiting staff kept coming by and tried to fill our water glass w/ regular water so we had to keep saying no to the waiting staff and explained that we were drinking sparkling water. This became so annoying and one of them actually succeed to pour still water to my half drunk sparkling water. It's no big deal but why taking bottle away and made this annoying situation. FoodFood was the highlight of this restaurant. I had roasted chicken & veggies w au jou. It had all part of chicken meat, wing, breast, thigh and leg.Chicken was tender and had right amount of salt and roast veggies were well roasted and au jus was wonderful! My wife has steak and fries which were wonderful as well. Appetizer and dessert were also great!OverallI don't know if I want to go back here because of the wide open cafeteria-ish seating area and untrained waiting staff. But food was great.

The manager reached out to me afterwards and invited me back for a complimentary dinner for two.To start, we ordered the mousse de foie gras and the stuffed quail. By far, the stuffed quail was the best thing we ate that night. The meat was juicy and tender on the inside, but the outside was crispy from the roasting. It came with a balsamic glaze which complimented the sweet and salty meat. The foie gras was also delicious. I just wish it came with more bread!For entrees, I ordered the Côte de Veau aux Champignons and my boyfriend ordered the New York Strip Steak. My veal was so tender and the right amount of chewiness. I am not usually a fan of sweetbreads, but the ones that came with my veal were great! Definitely order this dish if you like sweetbreads. I also really enjoyed the mushrooms that came with my veal. The flavors were just right with the sauce. My boyfriend's steak came cooked perfectly and it was good, but I preferred mine. We paired our steaks with the Hypothesis Cabernet, which is absolutely delicious.We ended the meal with the pistachio bombe glacée. This was spectacular! My boyfriend, that isn't a fan of desserts or chocolate in general loved this. The ganache was rich and it was a delight watching our waiter pour it over the ice cream. Even if I am not in the mood for dinner, I would come back just for this dessert.Emil was our server. He was very knowledgable about the menu and had a lot of suggestions for us.

For starters, we had the mussels, which were very flavorful and a seafood salad, which was refreshing and full of large shrimp and crab meat. For my main entree, I chose the NY strip -- it was cooked to perfection and boasting with fresh-off-the-grill flavor! It came with a small salad (which may have just been garnish lol) but I got a caesar salad as my side dish. Not the best, but it worked. My friend opted for the popular steak frites (almost every table there ordered this). The steak (although a different cut) had the same grill flavor and the fries were amazing - I think I ate most of them. For dessert, we got the creme brulee.

The bus boy was very quick to clear glasses that had not been finished. Annoying, but fine by itself. The sommelier was really pushing an expensive Pomerol to follow up the Grand Cru Classe we had finished. Again, I get it. But the look I got when I ordered a lighter and less expensive wine was like I had personally insulted the waiters wife, and he sent the sommelier over to condescendingly confirm my decision, and of course suggest a more expensive version bc they were out of what I had ordered.

We didn't have reservations and walked into three different places before we could get into Boucherie for dinner. Food was good and the services wasn't too bad till the end.Across the isle from me were a group of 16 men all younger and dressed up in suits.  They looked amazing all sitting there lined up and happy.  Yes so much happiness and joy coming from all of them. A few guys arrived late and greeted the table with a hug and a kiss to each member.  It was so nice to see genuine love right in front of you. My BFF and I finished dinner and I couldn't help myself. I walked up to the table and asked if the occasion was a bachelor or birthday party? The guys said no, not exactly.  I left it at that and started to walk away.Then my waiter stops me and says to me, they are all females.  I said, what did you say?

My coworker had the Provence (absinthe and lavender vodka), and seemed to enjoy it as well. If you're not in a cocktail mood, there are plenty of wines to choose from.

Steak Frites au Poivre: (coworker ordered this but I sampled): excellently prepared steak with peppercorn sauce, crispy and delicious fries.

The decor, the food, the service, and just about everything else was topnotch! I was lucky enough to come here 3 times in the span of 3 months. Zorica, the manager, and everyone else who works there were so welcoming and friendly. Unfortunately, I can't recall the names of the previous 2 servers but during my last visit on Monday, we had the lovely Martha as our server. She wasn't the hovering type and gave my +1 and I the right amount of space. Whenever our orders came out, she would explain everything and then let us happily enjoy our meal, occasionally checking up on us to see if we needed refills on water/wine. She was very knowledgable on the menu--her wine recommendations were impeccable! Sadly, I didn't catch the names of them. I've tried most of their appetizers and I have to say, their ""escargots de bourgogne"" was the most mouth watering and is something I REALLY recommend. When you dip bread in the oil, make sure to get the bits of garlic and lemon--it's like buttery goodness!  On my most recent visit, we ordered the ""filet de boeuf"" which was the filet mignon with truffle butter. The meat was SO tender and juicy. The truffle butter brought out such delicious aroma and flavor! I got the ""steak frites au poivre"" which was the NY strip and double fried french fries. OH. MY. GOD. You know a steak is good when you don't even want to dip it in the sauce it comes with. The cherry on top was the teeny charred parts...heaven.Their desserts explode in your mouth..definitely hits the spot for someone with a sugar-tooth.

355,2018-02-07,5.0,"Boucherie is the West Village's Mario Batali or Paul Bocuse (RIP :(): it seems all the more extravagant and hedonistic because of sheer size, an overwhelming presence in a neighborhood where restaurants are otherwise charming because they are minuscule. It's very Parisian, not just in decor and the easygoing elegance of the staff. There is something quintessentially French about Boucherie's lived-in ostentatiousness, like it is not just an expectation that you eat your weight in foie and crème brûlée, but that you enjoy it like you've never enjoyed anything as much as dining at Boucherie.Speaking of crème brûlée, let's start there and work our way back to the starters. In a phrase, it is the crème-de-la-crème of all crème brûlée: impossibly smooth, rich without being cloying, with just a hint of sweetness that you know is thanks to an overpriced vanilla pod (from a far-flung corner of the world!) they threw in there. The raspberries and strawberries that kiss the crunchy crust are more for decoration than added flavor, as the custard really speaks for itself. We also ordered the protiferoles, which did not ""wow"" nearly as much as the crème brûlée. It may have been because the CB was just that good, or because the protiferoles were almost too lavish; the choux sandwiching the ice cream was slightly dry.For entrées, we tried the rack of lamb and filet mignon. Nothing particularly noteworthy for these, other than they were done just right. The steak was smokey and sinful the way perfectly-charred meats get more delicious with each bite. The lamb was juicy and very gamey; like most everything on the steak menu at Boucherie, it is not for the faint of heart. Starters were, again, stellar: a deliciously-airy mousse de foie gras (there are very few places even in France, I think, that one could find a foie so lightweight yet so funky); buttery escargots (not too salty, merci!); expertly-seasoned steak tartare. Strangely, thinking back on those delectably-simple yet oh-so-enticing plates, I'm reminded of a poem of Neruda's: """"I shivered in those / solitudes / when I heard / the voice / of / the salt / in the desert."" What I loved most about Boucherie, aside from the beautiful space and welcoming service, was that salt was *not* the pervading overtone. Instead, it was coupled with all those other flavors and textures that would indeed make you shiver, with every next indulgent bite.",-0.8983050847457628,0.20907335907335908

Very rarely does my rating differ more than 2 stars from the yelp nation but on this one it was the case. My experience was no more than 2 stars and heres why:Sat the bar and although the bartender was extremely nice and helpful it was way too cramped. They really pack this place in and you are on top of each other with no elbow room. We started with the cheese plate which my wife loves and it was good. The caesar salad was good but lacked that punch of flavor in homemade caesar dressing that puts it over the top. The holy grail of caesar salad is at MASH in london but thats a different review...We then tried some steaks. My wife ordered the filet and I ordered the $65 steak I forget what type. My steak had a bitter charred/burnt taste on the outside which overwhelmed the whole steak. It was top 5 worst I have had. The filet was edible but it was overcooked based on our order (medium) and not the greatest.  For our sides we had the potato gratin which was bland. It needed salt and some flavor. The potatoes were cooked right but missed in the flavor department.We then had the creme brulee which had good flavor but the true test of a creme brulee is the top and it should be caramelized to the point that it makes a sound if you tap on it with a spoon. This lacked that type of caramelization and so the textures melted together. Not the best.Overall, for the price and the high yelp reviews this place missed the mark BIG TIME.

My omelet was terrific and worth the $20, but just about everything else on the menu seems almost 25-50% more expensive than at similar places.

I was very happy about that, as it doesn't always happen at restaurants. Food:I ordered mussels for appetizer, I loved the platting of it, beautiful presentation. The sauce was a wine reduction and it was nice. This dish was served with fresh black mussels and only one of them showed up empty. They topped it off with some slices pepper and mini pepperoni pieces.The chef was heavy handed on the salt and pepper, so I drank a lot of water with every bite. And my server probably didn't hear me tell him how salty it was...And it wasn't quality for a 6oz steak that was served pre-cut. However the fries with it was supber! It was just right in every way. I wasn't a fan with the wine gravy it came with.The favorite of tonight was the chocolate mouse dessert !

366,2018-01-28,5.0,"This was my second time at Boucherie, and given that my first trip was a solid one (4 stars), I had little expectation for that to be topped. But boy was I wrong, and here I am rectifying my first review, to one of 5 stars.First up, the atmosphere in this place won't fail to amaze. The interior is beautiful and there's a hustle and bustle, and attractive busy-ness to the place. You can hear the low buzz of chatter, waiters explaining dishes to other guests, as well as also being able to nose a look at what other delightful dishes your neighbouring tables are ordering. The place is fancy, but not overwhelmingly so - it's definitely a place to take someone when you're trying to impress, but is also perfectly fine for a casual catch up with friends & family as well.As soon as we sat down, we were plied with ice cold water, and drinks menus, as well as quick follow ups, followed by even quicker drinks service - the cocktails were really really great. Boozy and fruity, without being sweet and sickly.Now onto the good bit WHICH WAS THE FOOOOOD. Before even ordering, you get a mini platter of olives, peppers, bread and butter which was a really nice touch.For starters we got the French Onion Soup and the Escargot.The french onion soup was literally perfect. Salty and sweet oniony broth topped with gooey charred cheese. Plunging through the cheese and seeing it swirl with the broth below was a thing of beauty.The Escargot were grilled to perfection, leaving little pools of garlic, buttery goodness in the little divots of the plate it was served in - perfect for dunking that bread in! The snails themselves also had a great texture. So many times when I've had snails before they've just been tough and chewy, but these little suckers almost melted in your mouth.On to the mains, and lined up we have the Rack of Lamb and the Bone-in New York strip with a side of ratatouille.First up, I have to give another shout out to the fries (see first review)...these truly are some of the best fries I've ever had. They're so crispy, but fluffy on the inside - perfect vehicle for a good dunk of tomato sauce, or of steak juice.The Lamb was perfectly cooked and also a generous portion - 4 chops on the rack, with a crispy little rib of fat that just melted along side the meat. It's also served with some crushed potatoes as well as some tomatoes and greens.The bone-in New York Strip was also just as good as the lamb. Cooked exactly as it should be (medium rare) with a light crust on the outside that complimented the succulence of the meat like no other. You can also dig a nice little bit of bone marrow out of the bone if you're into that sort of thing.Ratatouille was also great. Zesty and fresh and was a great cut-through vs the fattier side of the meal.Last up, we have the dessert - now I'm not really a dessert person. I'll always go savoury given the choice, and I was stuffed at this point...but my girlfriend had clocked a dessert the girl on the table next to us was having, and as such, also had to have it.The Pistachio Bombe Glacee is every bit as good as it sounds. It has the spectacle of the molten chocolate being poured over it. It has the cold and creamy interior of the pistachio ice cream...and the nutty/chocolatey shell that holds it all together gives a nice little crunch - really is one of the best desserts I've ever had.SO folks, all of the above is basically a long summary of why you should go to Boucherie. However, if you can't be bothered to read all of that, then simply know this:GREAT ATMOSPHERE, FOOD COOKED TO PERFECTION, ATTENTIVE STAFF AND BRILLIANT COCKTAILS - all at an incredibly fair price.GO HERE",5.6230769230769235,0.24830948372615033
367,2018-01-28,3.0,"We dined at Boucherie on a busy Saturday night. Boucherie is a bustling, two-floor French bistro with  a menu heavy on French classics and dry-aged Pat LaFrieda steak. Our four-top was sat in quite possibly the only relatively quiet corner of the restaurant in the upper level wine cellar. For appetizers, we started with an order of foie gras and an order of escargot. It was my first time trying foie gras and while it was good when paired with the pickled beets and greens on a crostini, it was not something I'd likely try again. While I did not try the escargot (which got rave reviews from those who did eat them) I did dip a piece of bread in the remaining garlic butter and HOLY MOLY that butter is life changing. For mains, the table shared the butcher block, ordered medium rare, as well as sides of creamed spinach and sautéed mushrooms. The butcher block was beautifully presented on a large cutting board with four different sauces. It included filet mignon, strip steak, hanger steak, and bone marrow. All meats were cooked properly and lacked basic seasoning. The strip was a bit more fatty than I like and the hanger was a bit too tough, but the filet was complete perfection. It was my first time trying bone marrow. It was melted in your mouth, but the texture was not something I particularly cared for. The sautéed mushrooms were well prepared, but the creamed spinach left much to be desired. The sautéed spinach was separated from the cream in an off-putting way. The cocktail menu is heavy on an Americanized version of absinthe. I tried the lavender martini, and while it was a very unique flavor, it wasn't a drink I could have more than one of. I then enjoyed a dry rose with my dinner. My fiancé and his father ordered Tito's on the rocks, which were brought to them neat. Vodka is not typically ordered or served without ice, making this a strange mix-up.Put simply, the service was disappointing. For a meal of this price, our expectations for service were far from met. We waited ten minutes before being approached for our drink order. After the mix-up regarding the Tito's, it took yet another ten minutes before the proper cocktails were delivered. While we were tucked in a corner of the restaurant, we rarely could find our server; we seemed to be his only table in this section of the restaurant. After ordering espressos and cappuccinos, they were delivered with some confusion. One espresso was ordered decaf, and the server seemed to think the espresso was caffeinated. While we sent the hot beverages back and wanted them taken off the bill, the Tito's on the rocks on her tray was also (mistakenly) taken away. We had to track down our server yet again to get the Tito's delivered. After finishing our meal and drinks, we had to finally ask another server for our bill because our server was nowhere to be found.",5.6230769230769235,0.08675379572118704

The ribeye was MASSIVE and so savory, can feed at least 3 people. Bone marrow was huge and had a softer texture that was rich in flavor. Mussels were solid and the onion soup was super tasty, the cheese on it was really top notch.

The ambiance and decor is very French, old, rustic walls, very dimmed lights, marble small tables, etc. Two of us had mussels for the appetizer and the other friend had arugula salad. All were happy with the choices. Then we ordered steak for an entree. We all received them in the temperature we asked which is a really rare case in the steakhouses. Another bonus for Boucheria. The fries were perfect, PERFECT! I substituted my french fries to salad which also was good and had the lemony dressing that went very well with my steak, but kind of regretted not taking fries and stole a few from my friends' plates. The steak came with a rich creamy peppercorn sauce that was fantastic. It took away the boring meat taste and dryness from the steak. Dessert - the two of us had apple tatin and one chocolate mousse. Again, everyone was happy. I ate every bit of my dessert even though I wasn't planing to.  I also had latte and it was strong just the way I like.Now about the service. It was excellent, Im not even exaggerating. Our server whose name is Emil was so tentative, so nice, so accommodative and had a great sense of humor. I think he was French, amazing server.

371,2018-01-25,3.0,"I made some corrections to my original review below:The actual General Manager contacted me. It was the Assistant Manager that I had issues with (which were addressed). She was very sorry for my experience and wanted to make it up to me. However, I can't get past the way I was treated. Regardless of not knowing how to process an Open Table payment (which was straightforward and totally not their issue) , it was the lack of accountability and disappointing a customer. I am changing my review from 1 Star to 3 Stars but declining the offer to go back. Here's why:************The Assistant Manager would not take my Open Table dining rewards MasterCard. I repeatedly told her if she read the directions and typed it in like a credit card she can process my payment. Pretty straight-forward. I specifically chose / applied my Open Table points for this restaurant, so I would be losing $50 if she did not process it. She didn't care. She also refused to read my confirmation email with the instructions and shrugged me off, then said another patron came in the other night trying to use their rewards card and told them she couldn't use it either. Strange she would even bring it up. So it shows me she disappointed another because she was too lazy to figure it out. However, the wait staff was excellent, and they felt bad their Assistant Manager didn't take care of the situation but had to follow her guidelines. Guidelines? The right guidelines is to take care of your customers, not dismiss because you don't want to be solution -oriented operator and go through the proper channels - ie . Read the email and type the damn number into your POS system?!So now I'm out $50. Extremely disappointed and I will NOT be going back. How ironic I was there for NY restaurant week, which the intent is to acquire new customers, but instead they lost one. Well, actually now 2 because my friend I was with isn't going back either. Minetta Tavern is way better down the street. No need to stop by this uppity establishment. And in my opinion Minetta has way better steak frites. The mussels were super watering.

We ordered the french onion soup and the brussel sprout salad - both of which were great and the perfect amount of food to share before the main course. Not sure if I should be embarrassed or proud, but we all ordered the steak frites, medium rare. Our server told us about the Butcher Block, but we still came here for one thing and we all felt strongly about sticking to it. None of us regretted it, I can tell you that.

Ambiance: I absolutely love the ambiance and the decor of Boucherie. The candlelit tables are intimate enough for dates, and the restaurant is spacious enough to comfortably host larger groups as well as events. I love the open kitchen, giving us a peak into how the plates are beautifully put together and presented. FOOD: I've been lucky to try a number of dishes from them and they have all been amazing! The escargot is so buttery and rich in flavor, that the remaining sauce definitely becomes the perfect dipping companion for the bread. It was my first time trying quail, and their stuffed quail surprisingly tasted like a very well seasoned meatball. The NY strip was perfectly cooked on the inside, and charred on the outside offering that crisp flavor. The veal porterhouse was tender, and the veal jus made it absolutely amazing! The sweet bread and mushrooms complimented the dish very well. What better way to end the meal, than creme brûlée! Their creme brûlée is delicious, topped with fresh berries. Their food portions overall are pretty generous. Service: The service here is absolutely phenomenal. Zorica (the manager) has been such a gracious host from the very beginning, and all the waiters really work together and make you feel like family. I had the pleasure of meeting Chef Jerom during my first visit, and he made it even more memorable the second time around saying hello and signing my book.

381,2018-01-17,5.0,"I recently attended yelp event at this restaurant (which was the most highlighted event that I attended in 2017) and was invited back by the manager for a complimentary meal.My boyfriend and I arrived at the restaurant for 6pm Sunday night reservation and we were surprised that there were few diners. Half an hour later, practically every table was full!  We sat in the upper level and had a full view of the restaurant and the lovely Christmas tree. Our waiter Emil was lovely.  He made sure we were taken care of and we observed him being very jolly with guests, especially a young birthday boy! To start of the night we ordered cocktails. A Pocket Square for him and a Provence Martini for me.  He throughly enjoyed the Pocket Square as it had more of a lemony note while my Martini was definitely stronger with the unique lavender flavor.The appetizers were amazing.  I had had the steak tartare during the yelp event and was craving it for the longest time so naturally that was one of the appetizers we ordered.  You don't even notice that you're eating raw steak because it was flavored so well and had a sort of creamy texture. We also ordered the mousse de foie gras.  This was the dish that I was most interested in trying.  I have had foie gras before at a different restaurant in an underwhelming experience so the fact that Boucherie does a foie gras mousse was very intriguing. The foie gras by itself was bland, but when you combine it with salad and the onion compote it was like a colorful explosion in my mouth.  The sweet caramelize taste of the red wine port sauce on the compote really added a new dimension to the foie gras. The foie gras was my favorite dish of the night.For the main we ordered the Faux-Filet Bercy-16oz dry aged NY strip and the Cote de Veau Aux Champignons-16oz veal porterhouse.  To accompany our entrees we asked our waiter for red wine recommendations.  He suggested both a French and an American wine which went very well with our meal. Both entrees were cooked perfectly well to medium rare.  I did find the salted charred outside of the cuts to be a bit distracting, partly because I'm not a big fan of salt. The filet and the veal were both delicious, but I enjoyed the veal more as it was different and more tender than I expected.  It was my first time trying veal.  I didn't care too much for the sauce of the enochi mushroom, but the sweetbread was a surprise - extremely tender with a subtle flavor.After the heavy meal we were contemplating a lighter dessert yet we were unsure of what to choose.  Our waiter suggested the Pistachio Bombe Glacee since another table had ordered it and enjoyed it very much. It is pistachio ice cream on top of a brownie with a chocolate ganache glaze which is poured over the dessert at the table. The chocolate glaze and the brownie was the overpowering flavor of the dessert. We actually didn't taste any pistachio flavor in the ice cream when we ate it separately which was a slight disappointment.Overall it was a very enjoyable meal in which we spent 3hrs going through the courses.  No rush at all and as we sat on the upper level we observed many customers enjoying their meal and eating for pleasure.  Thank you Boucherie and Zorica for inviting us back.  There are definitely other dishes that we would come back to try!",-2.436842105263158,0.19977914597479815

The mushroom side and the spinach side had no flavor. The fries were good.  The potato gratin was actually cold (seriously, they couldn't warm it in 1,5 hours?). The apps were underwhelming: a flavorless seafood salad, and a flavorless foie gras mousse (how is that even possible?). Oh, and ""taking care of us"" apparently meant desserts on the house.

Our waiter knew from the beginning that this was a free meal yet he was still very attentive and helpful with the menu items and the food came in a timely order (of course we left him a hefty tip for his tremendous service). We started with the foie gras and that was delicious. When we ran out of the bread that came with the dish, our waiter brought us a new basket of bread. The mussels are absolutely a must have, I love the sauce and love smothering my bread in it. Just so flavorful without completely taking away the mussel flavor.

My boyfriend went with the filet mignon and again, the meat was just so tender.

The restaurant itself is architecturally stunning and in a great location at the crossroads of West Village and Greenwich Village. The entire space was decked out with lights and decorations for the holiday season, and as a high-scale French bistro turned winter wonderland (complete with a towering, glittery Christmas tree), it is the perfect place for a spendy, indulgent meal whether that be with family and friends or for a romantic night out. At the event, we got to meet all the staff, including the executive chef Jerom Dihui, and had a stunning meal consisting of filet mignon, steak frites, rib-eye, salmon, scallops, and more. Everything was done perfectly and the entire waitstaff was courteous and professional.At dinner a week later, my friend and I returned for a full meal and were absolutely blown away. True to its ""butcher"" name, the menu is heavy on its proteins and lean meats, but also contains an assortment of pastas, salads, and whatnot. But, if you're going to come here, it definitely should be for the meat. My friend and I started the night out with drinks, her with a glass of red wine and me with the Old Tom Sling. Our waiter brought over multiple bottles for her to sample and explained the background and origin of each; needless to say, we were both very impressed and she was ultimately very pleased with her choice. My cocktail was also a waiter recommendation; the hibiscus and plum flavors themselves paired well with one another though I'm not the biggest fan of gin, so next time I'd be sure to get something else.Then, appetizers. My friend ordered the mousse de foie gras and I got the escargots de bourgogne. The foie gras was glorious. The escargots made me cry tears of joy. Paired with the complimentary bread basket and antipasto, both were so stunningly perfect. The foie gras is rich, very rich, and topped with an onion compote and a red wine port sauce. We went through a good two baskets of ciabatta bread to finish off the pâté. The escargots were unbelievably tender, and soaked in this garlic butter sauce that was absolutely divine. We actually ended up finishing another full basket of bread to soak up its remainder.Three baskets of bread, two entire appetizers, and a couple of drinks in, we were full, but luckily there was time to breathe between courses. A good half hour later, our main entrees were ready. I originally had wanted the filet mignon, but our waiter heartily recommended the dry-aged bone-in strip steak. I'm so happy I went with that instead, because, my god was it good. The steak was perfectly medium rare, rubbed and crusted with ample salt and pepper. It was so tender and flavorful that it didn't even require any of the sauce that was brought out. My friend ordered the steak frites; she loved the pepper sauce that topped the steak and was absolutely blown away by the fries. We both were; in fact, I was nearly eating off her plate by the end of the night.We ended the meal with an order of the profiteroles, a generous plate of perfectly softened cream puffs and ice cream. By this time we were so full that we could hardly taste it, but regardless, it was the perfect way to close out such a rich, delicious meal.The whole dinner was a good 3-4 hour long ordeal. Our waiter was beyond attentive, refilling waters constantly and brushing off tablecloth crumbs and offering up personal recommendations. Zorica and her team were just as great, making the two of us feel welcomed and coming over to chat with us personally. Boucherie definitely offers a fantastic dining experience; extremely authentic to French cuisine and very much worth checking out. The entire restaurant reminded me of a more refined, higher-end Balthazar. If you're looking for a fancy yet delicious meal, perhaps for a special occasion or company dinner, this is the place to go.",-21.025000000000002,0.32300377468060393
386,2018-01-05,5.0,"My husband and I decided that I would determine our Valentine's day dinner plans last year as he was completely swamped at work... being indecisive and with too many options, I made and cancelled about 10 different reservations, finally booking at about 5pm on Valentine's day afternoon a table at Boucherie.  I waited until he was out of the subway to tell him where to go and he managed to beat me to the restaurant.  They told him they didn't have our 8:00pm reservation (I accidentally made it for the following day) and were booked solid all night - luckily, they said that all they could offer us was the grill table. DONE!It was a cozy bar style table overlooking the grills where we could watch all of the steaks get done - perfect for two carnivore foodies on a cold winter night.  We ordered the Cote de boeuf pour deux (bone marrow and a huge Tomahawk steak which easily was our dinner the following night too), creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin.  Due to the long passage of time since this dinner, I can't recall whether we also ordered the escargot, but I do remember everything being excellent - food, classic Parisian ambiance, service.  It was a lucky and great find, and eleven months later I am still thinking of it because I would love to go back!",-21.025000000000002,0.1996376811594203
387,2018-01-03,5.0,"Came back here after Christmas with my BFF to do a christmas exchange and it was the perfect place for such a setting. This restaurant truly is beautiful with its high ceilings and wonderful decor. During the christmas season, this place was decked out in sparkling lights and a giant christmas tree. It definitely held the holiday spirit, great place for a date, friends catchup or even group parties as this place is quite spacious.I was excited to eat here again but I got more excited when I saw that they revamped their menu from when I last was here. We started off with some complimentary bread and antipasti. Then the really good stuff!Steak Tartare - I got this last time and I had to get it again. It is just so good, fresh, well seasoned and really well portioned. Caille Farcie - Stuffed quail with foi gras and a balsamic glaze. Amazing and can easily be split between two to three people. And I mean easy! The meat was so tender and soft. It came out looking like the bird but it was boneless for the most part and easy to cut. It was absolutely delicious. The flavor was spectacular, accented by the fattyness of the foi gras. Definitely a must get!Lamb Rack - Hefty in portions, perfectly cooked at medium rare. The meat was easy to cut, super moist with a nice little herb crust on the outside. I devoured it!Cassolet Maison - duck confit with pork belly, sausage and white beans. Also very large in portion! The beans were cooked down nicely and there was plenty of all three meats in this dish. Just as good as all the other dishes I had.In addition to the entrees, we also got a side of the fries and Gratin de pommes de terre. I love love love their fries. Came out pipping hot. Crisp on the outside, soft and potatoey on the inside. I got this last time and I just had to do it again. As full as I was, I had to make room for it. We ended the delicious meal with creme brulee and a chocolate souffle with pistachio ice cream. Both really good ends to a wonderful meal. The creme brulee had a nice custard like taste to it and the souffle was moist and soft. Overall, five thumbs up. So glad we came back here. I think it's going to have to be a Christmas tradition going forward!",-15.916666666666666,0.36004431216931226
388,2018-01-02,5.0,"Initially went here for a yelp event then returned later for dinner, I found Boucherie to be a fantastic French brasserie with cuisine equivalent to those delectable brasseries I dined at the Latin Quarter in Paris.  Whereas most NYC french brasseries are small & intimate & possibly cramped--Boucherie is  capital L-Large as it is situated in a former theater ie the Circle Repertory Theater and now seats up to 320 people for brunch, lunch & dinner.  The brasserie's name Boucherie is French for ""butcher"" and appropriately so as in addition to a more traditional brasserie fare (onion soup, duck confit, coq au vin, bouillabaisse) there is a respectable steakhouse menu to be perused.  In fact many of the large format two person steaks are decadent enough and marbled enough to be worthy of Quality Meats, del Frisco's ilk.  The prices of steak certainly match those of standalone NYC steakhouses.  We ordered the mousse de foie gras & the saint jacques a la Provencale (sea scallops with crushed tomato, garlic fennel) as starters.  My husband was favorably impressed by portion sizes for both.  The scallops especially were cooked perfectly--succulent and not even a hint of overcooking.  The mousse de foie gras was balanced with the onion compote providing sweet notes & greens providing the acidic component.  We also had cocktails with dinner: Old Tom Sling, Vieiu Amie, provence martini & bastille sour.  Among these four the best was the Old Tom Sling(gin, amaro, grenadine, hibiscus & lemon lime) but all were decent & stiff drinks (so worthy of $15 pricetag).  Next we both had offerings from the meaty steakhouse half of the menu:  I had the faux filet bercy (or a 16 oz dry age bone in ny strip) and my husband chose the weekly rotating ""Cut of the week"" which this frosty first week of January was Cotes de Chevreuil (or a Huge herb crusted Mountain River rack of venison with vegetables & demi glaze).  Both cooked to order (rare/medium rare as all quality red meats should be!).  We loved both--the permanently available bone in ny strip had a perfectly seasoned crust & the special offer venison was so tender.  As it really is hard to find good venison in nyc restaurants--it was the highlight of our week to get to order this!  We had the gratinated potatoes as a side (very fatty & rich but expected nothing less as french cuisine & butter are pretty much synonymous).  Finally dessert offering are classic French bistro/brasserie fare: creme brûlée, profiteroles, chocolate mousse etc--we had the creme brûlée and it was large enough to share & most importantly the custard had the vanilla bean specks that I always search for in a properly pedigreed french brûlée.  Overall Boucherie is a vast improvement from the cramped average faceless french brasseries you find in nyc especially  on upper east side--Boucherie is both a respectable steakhouse & a French comfort food bistro rolled into one.  On a side note: although we visited without children tonight--we are always on lookout for good eats that we can bring our little ones along to so I inquired & Boucherie is very kid friendly with high chairs, booster seats & diaper change tables available.  We plan to try bringing kids for Brunch on weekends.",-15.75,0.17272361647361648
389,2018-01-02,5.0,"Wow, Boucherie, thanks for existing. Within one month, I went to Boucherie three times and it was three different settings - 1. Yelp tasting event, 2. one-on-one dinner with a friend, 3. group birthday dinner. First, let's talk about the interior. Boucherie is a scaled-up French inspired restaurant, and of course, the decor has to match. It's a very spacious two-floor restaurant, with dim lighting and beautiful decor - there was a huge Christmas tree during the holidays. It's perfect for a date night or even a group dinner! 1. During the Yelp tasting event, I was able to try a variety of their appetizers and different cuts of meat. I couldn't get enough! French cuisine has always been my favorite, and they definitely set the bar really high for all NYC restaurants. The main takeaway from this experience was that even though we were non-paying customers, the servers were still extremely attentive and made sure everything was perfect. This is why I would recommend people to go!2. I went back a week later to eat with a friend. I wanted to taste the other appetizers that I wasn't able to try during the tasting event. To start, my friend and I shared the steak tartare and scallops. The scallops were amazing - extremely juicy and flavored perfectly. The sauce was perfect; we literally scraped the plate clean with the bread. I've never had steak tartare and was hesitant to try. But I was surprised how much I liked it. They serve it with flavored toasted bread and it really enhanced the taste. As for our entrees, we both got the Filet de Boeuf. Again, it was flavored perfectly and the truffle butter was the cherry on top. For dessert, we tried the Crepes Suzette, warm crepes and ice cream? Yes, please!Our dining experience was fantastic, we got to sit on the second floor, which overlooked the first floor and their beautiful Christmas tree. Too bad, it wasn't a date, otherwise, it would've been very romantic. 3. I returned a week later (I'm addicted, can you tell?), with a group of 8 people for a birthday dinner. We made the reservation on OpenTable and noted that it was a birthday celebration. We were seated immediately and greeted by the Zorica, the Manager, with champagne. What a lovely surprise and kind gesture. We were then greeted by our awesome server, Andres. He took time out to explain the whole menu and suggested that we do family style. He recommended his favorites and we ordered it all! - Escargot de Bourgogne - buttery and perfectly seasoned - Scallops - again, I scraped the sauce off the plate- Moules Basquaise - I'm biased because I love mussels but the white wine sauce was amazing- Raviolis aux Champignons - mushroom ravioli, highly recommend!- Confit de Canard - Confit duck leg - too dry in my opinion- 40 oz ribeye - literally MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH. It also comes with the bone marrow, highly recommend!- 16 oz bone-in New York Strip- for sides, we ordered the pommes frites, ratatouille, gratin de pommes de terre, and creamed spinach - all were great!- for desserts, we were able to sample a few things - Crème Brulee, Crepes Suzette, Tarte Tatin, and Profiteroles - all amazing. Andres and Zorica were there the whole time making sure we had a perfect experience. I felt like they were dining with us too! Thanks for the amazing dining experience, I will be returning and I will recommend to all my friends!",-15.75,0.3332773892773893
390,2017-12-31,5.0,"This French inspired restaurant in the West Village specialises in meat - and lots of it. The restaurant is large, impeccably decorated and was pumping when we arrived around 7pm on a Friday. With the assistance of the sommelier, we picked out a glass of Chardonnay to pair with our appetiser - the escargots. These lovely, garlic butter infused morsels went down beautifully with the wine and left us primed for what was to come. On to the main event, we didn't mess around and went straight for the tomahawk ribeye steak for two. The meat came out, beautifully presented with the bone (marrow included) asking to be gnawed upon. The meat was perfectly cooked, medium rare and full of flavour. The marrow was rich and sweet, really rounding out the dish. We ordered a serve of fries to accompany this course which were great. A bottle of French red (can't remember the variety) was an excellent pairing with the red meat. One note, this dish is enormous and could comfortably feed three people, although we somehow managed to fight through and eat most of it. When it came time for dessert, we were already uncomfortably full. Luckily we made the decision to loosen our belts and squeeze in the créme brûlée. The crispy outer shell housed a magnificent vanilla custard which we worked out way through before rolling out the door and back home.",-18.566666666666666,0.35030103995621237

393,2017-12-29,5.0,"Absolutely wonderful meal in a beautiful setting. Boucherie is kind of a scaled-up French Bistro concept that has been slightly tweaked for American diners. True to its name, the menu leans meat and game-heavy, with an emphasis on steaks and other offerings from the land. In honor of the holiday season, the spacious dining room was gloriously decked out and even featured a towering tree with all kinds of lovely baubles and balls. This is an ideal location if you're looking for a spendy, romantic meal before Christmas or New Years. I started with the lavender gin cocktail which was delicious and refreshing and it took all my self-control not to drink it too fast. The steak tartare with quail egg is a MUST try. I'm usually very picky about my tartare but this one is really great and the egg makes it almost creamy. SO had the mushroom ravioli which was also delicious and to share, we had a huge medium rare porterhouse with scalloped potatoes and mushrooms. Everything was so decadent that we skipped dessert and took home leftovers.",-17.337500000000002,0.4222348484848485
394,2017-12-29,5.0,"I first got a tasting at Boucherie when I was invited by a friend as her +1. Prior to even knowing about that event I had already booked my birthday dinner here in advance just purely off the photos of the restaurant and some of the reviews I've read.Made a reservation for 8 via opentable and was seated promptly upon arrival. The décor/ambiance of the restaurant is absolutely beautiful and I expect it changes with the season; currently there is a large Christmas tree in the center the restaurant. Because we were there for a birthday dinner the restaurant gave all us girls a complimentary round of champagne to start off the evening; what a nice surprise! Upon being seated you are handed two menus: one menu features appetizers, entrees, and specials of the day, and the other menu is all steaks. For a party of 8 we decided to order everything family style and we got the Escargot de Bourgogne (very good and buttery), the Scallops (highly recommend), the Moules Basquaises (that white wine reduction sauce is the bomb), Raviolis aux Champaignons (this mushroom ravioli is so good and highly recommend), Confit duck leg (we ordered this based off other reviews we read but it was a bit disappointing to me as it was too dry), and to compliment the 40 oz ribeye (melt in your mouth delicious - highly recommend), and 16 oz bone-in New York Strip,  we got pommes frites, gratin de pommes de terre, ratatouille, and creamed spinach. For dessert we had the Crème Brulee (I don't like crème brulee but this one was absolutely delicious), Crepes Suzette (this was so good as it was a nice mix between the warm crepes and the vanilla ice cream), Tarte Tatin (also a nice play between warm and cold and perhaps my favorite dessert of the evening), and Profiteroles (cream puff turned into an ice cream sandwich).Needless to say Boucherie provided us one of the best dining/service experiences, courtesy of Andre (our waiter) and Zorica (the manager), exceeded all my expectations, and will be one of the birthdays I'll keep in my memories for years to come.

First, my brother brought me here to celebrate my new job, second for the yelp elite Christmas event, third for a follow up complimentary dinner for two people from Zorica. The executive chef Jerome Dihui fed us a stunning meal including Escargots de bourgogne as an appetizer, Cassoulet maison for an entree, and profiteroles for dessert with glasses of red wine. My boyfriend visited me from LA and I reserved us this dinner for the dinner after Christmas. Zorica, the manager, always remembered me, has always been particularly attentive that it continues to impress me how hospitable and effortless she makes running a restaurant seem, and the attentive customer service like them dusting off bread crumbs from my tablecloth, replacing my boyfriends dirty plate before he notices, impresses me. Escargots de bourgogne - snails with parsley, butter, lemon, garlic, and shallots- blew our mind. The sauce was so good I'd rather dip the complimentary bread into it than any other sauce.French onion soup- much better than the soups we had before throughout NYC.Duck confit w pork belly sausage and white beans- SO filling and so good.Thank you SO much Boucherie for making every meal and experience for me so memorable.

400,2017-12-26,5.0,"Been here twice in the last month and really enjoyed each meal. The first was a Yelp event where the restaurant hosted over 50 of us and served up light bites. My first impression was of all the holiday decorations which made it a great place to host a little holiday party. It had a warm and cozy feeling with the huge Christmas tree in the middle and the open kitchens bringing in a little fireplace warmth. For this event we ate family style sharing plates with small bites of steak tartare, gougeres, deviled eggs, scallops, salmon, steak, and seared tuna. My favorites were the gougeres and the salmon. The gougere was light with a nice cheesy (I think Gruyere) flavor that I found pretty addicting. I could have eaten a whole plate of these. While the steak was good, my favorite protein was the salmon just because I was so impressed by how they managed to keep the fish perfectly cooked when they were firing up so many of these for us. Considering that catering for large parties can often lead to mediocre, dry or overcooked food, Boucherie really delivered on serving our large party. My second time I came back for dinner and was even more impressed with the food. Escargot de Bourgogne - This was soooo good. If you like escargot, I would definitely recommend ordering it here. They do the typical garlic and butter but it was the taste of lemon that that added another layer of flavor. This item is also sharable since they put 2-3 escargot in each little well on the plate. Salade d'auvergne - My dining partner ordered this salad. I'm not a huge salad person but had a few bites. It was nicely dressed and had good textures. Salmon w Lentils - I had the salmon at the yelp event and liked it so much I just had to order it again. It was perfectly cooked and was delicious with the lentils on the side. Boucherie Burger - Although it was a little overdone, the meat was flavorful and juicy. The highlight though were the fries that had a really good crunch. Might just order a side of fries next time with whatever we get. Crepe Suzette - Super tasty. The crepes were nice and thin and there was an orange marmalade sauce. I love citrus and this did not disappoint.  Drink to get: Pocket Square - it's sweet and fruity and refreshingGreat food and service.

406,2017-12-17,5.0,"[Disclaimer: I was extended an invitation to have a complementary meal at  Boucherie by its management after dining at their sister restaurant, Olio e Piu. Below is completely honest and impartial review!]After a long work week, my boyfriend and I found ourselves at a table for two at Boucherie. To get down to it, our meal, as a whole, was a home run. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was cozy and the service was stellar.To start, we ordered *Escargots de Bourgogne*and *Saint Jacques a la Provencale* (seared scallops) for appetizers. We were then given suggestions on drinks: I ended up getting the aged Manhattan and my boyfriend got an old fashioned. When the appetizers rolled around, I was so excited. The escargots smelled amazing. This was our first time trying it and we were blown away. It was buttery, garlicky and ridiculously yummy. The scallops were seared perfectly and sat on top of crushed tomatoes which paired well together. For entrees, I got the *Faux Filet Bercy* and he got the *Veal Porterhouse.* Both great cuts and cooked to perfection. My steak was seasoned nicely - on the peppery side, however. The porterhouse came with mushrooms and a veal jus. The jus was served on the side, as opposed to on top of the veal, which gave you the power to add the sauce to your liking. For dessert, we REALLY enjoyed the *Crêpes Suzette.*The sauce was perfectly sweet (tangerine/orangey flavors), the crepe was the right amount of thickness and it was served with ice cream. I'm not a chocolate person but my boyfriend enjoyed the chocolate mousse!The service was a highlight for us. Everyone we encountered was so friendly and helpful - our server gave us space to breathe but came by often to ensure we were ok. We were invited for a complementary dinner so we were bound to encounter top notch service but I even looked around to observe the treatment of the parties around us and it seemed consistent across the board. We plan to come back and try out brunch! This place is a hit in the neighborhood, swing by and check it out for yourself.",-5.0440000000000005,0.3102353585112206
407,2017-12-16,1.0,Went there last night for dinner. Possibly the worst steak frites I have ever had in my life. The meat was a bad cut fatty and nervy. The fries omg greasy and plain awful. The au poivre sauce on top of the steak was poison. I mean how hard is to make a steak and French fries?! Suggestion for whomever made that meal. Change career. The price to get poisoned was $100 per person with the sommelier recommended bottle of wine which wasn't that great either.,-6.591666666666666,-0.20153769841269834

Their fries were probably the best thing that I had the chance to try, they were so crispy and so well seasoned, and the serving size was pretty generous.

Their seasoning was just-right and the meat was cooked at the perfect temperature. It would be improper to leave this review without mentioning their patience, helpful staff.

They also have these mini cheesy bread that is so soft and warm that I couldn't stop eating them!! All the ingredients they use are no doubt top notch ingredients. The waiters are all very friendly.

They were perfectly cooked and they looked amazing. It was a good sized appetizer, accompanied with some crunchy bread.The Boucherie menu is made up with a number of different fish and meat options. I've had meat from Pat LaFrieda before but not for some time and so I went for the filet de boeuf for my main, with a side of fries. The meat is topped with a truffle butter which isn't too overpowering and just adds the perfect amount of truffle flavor to the meat. The fries here are also quite something! Very crisp but fluffy at the same time.All of the desserts looked great but I went for the tarte tatin. A delicious classic, which in my opinion which topped off a faultless meal. I would totally recommend Boucherie to anyone reading this review. Granted, it's on the more expensive side but you get what you pay for.

417,2017-12-11,4.0,"Came here with my friend for lunch! We arrived at 1 on a Monday and there was no wait for a table. In fact, the restaurant was pretty empty so I don't think you really need a reservation for a weekday lunch. Decor is fancy and upscale but not pretentious. We had two waiters; the one who took our orders was pretty nice but the other one, not so much. He was attentive in refilling our waters though. We both ordered from the pre-fixe lunch menu, which I think is the best deal considering the prices of some of the entrees are already more the pre-fixe option itself but with the pre-fixe, you get an appetizer and an entree.Steak tartare- My first time trying raw beef...I really had no idea what to expect and after eating it, I can't really say I enjoyed it. It had some pretty nice flavors added to it, including capers and parsley but in the end, it still tasted like raw meat, which is something I'm just not used to eating. Comes with toast, a quail egg and a very tasty salad.Steak frites au poivre- Steak and fries yum!! The fries were spot on, super crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I've been so accustomed to fast food fries that I've forgotten what a legit French fry tastes like until now. As for the steak, cooked a perfect medium rare. It didn't quite have that melt in your mouth texture but it was definitely close. The sauce wasn't my favorite. This was a creamier butter sauce but I personally prefer a thinner and more sour sauce on my steaks.We ended up paying $50 each after tax and tip, which I think is reasonable for what we ordered. It is French food after all so you already know you're going to have to pay a little more $$$. I would say the food here is solid. Service could've been better for the type of dining environment we were in but it wasn't horrible. Overall, a nice French restaurant for a date.",-5.520833333333333,0.19694749694749691

BUT they immediately took it back with no complaint, then brought me out an AMAZINGLY cooked steak.Would recommend: steak frites, brussel sprout salad, filet, and (dessert special) with pistachio ice cream.

While it is modern and chic it has an atmosphere reminiscent of a bygone era that I really enjoyed. I sat at the bar and didn't try the food, so I can't speak to taste, but it smelled divine in there. The wine was fantastic, though it's a bit more expensive the experience alone is worth the extra few dollars.I think it makes for a great place to catch up, have a date, or a birthday dinner. The staff is dressed impeccably and are very friendly. The music is comforting and smooth and plays at the perfect volume to carry on a conversation without shouting.will most certianly be back!Update with food: The wait service was exquisite, the wine still delightful. The bread basket was perfect with the plives. I started had the ravioli with mushrooms and truffles and it was downright divine and my dinner guest had the fois gras, which she said was delicious. The appetizers portions were bigger than expected so I would recommended sharing an app. For our main course we had the chicken/potatoes and a steak. Everything was perfectly cooked. Though I'm pretty sure my guest got the wrong  order, but she said it was the best steak she had ever had and didn't even mind, Hahaha. Everything was cooked and flavored to perfection and the service was impeccable. For the dessert we had profiterols and the were light and creamy, but the portions were so generous that we could barely finish it to our disappointment. I look forward to going back!P.S.

In the end, we shared a tarte tatin with vanilla ice cream for dessert.  Everything is cooked and seasoned perfectly.  We love the classic French Bistro ambiance and decor.  Our waiter, Dragomir (I hope I got his name right) is most attentive and also a perfectionist.  He even offered his hand for me to hold when I was stepping down the stairs.  Isn't he sweet?

423,2017-12-04,5.0,"Went back recently and ordered a bunch of different items. For appetizers we had the Ravioli aux Champignon and Fruits de Mer. The ravioli was decadent. It had a mushroom filling and a black truffle butter sauce. There were also some burgundy truffles. This is probably one of the best ravioli dishes I've had. I would probably swim in that butter sauce and be content.The Fruits de Mer is a light and refreshing dish with lump crab, gulf shrimp, grapefruit, fennel and celery. It's sprinkled with a squirt of lemon which makes this like a French version of ceviche. Note: the crab and shrimp are not soaked in citrus, so it's technically NOT ceviche. This was a really great compliment to the rich ravioli since it was very light. For my main I had the filet mignon. It is was perfectly charred on the outside and ridiculous juicy on the inside. It was served with a two slices of truffle butter which took the steak to another level. Truffle butter and juicy filet mignon is an AMAZING combination.My wife had the rack of lamb and she thoroughly enjoyed it.For dessert we had the profiteroles which came highly recommended by our waiter. The profiteroles were drowning in a rich chocolate sauce. I enjoyed the ying-yang interplay between the pastry and the ice cream. The pastry ends were hot and crispy while the vanilla ice cream was very cold. The pastry chef must've put it together in a flash so that all the individual elements remained true. It was a great way to end our meal.Boucherie is a stellar French restaurant in West Village. Come by and check them out if you haven't already.",3.7857142857142856,0.2595238095238095

It's open space makes the place feel much smaller than it actually is. The bar has some sort of finished chrome that is like no other bar in the West village. The best part is the authentic Absinthe that's served drip drop. I don't know if any other place in the city that's like that. It was really good, but expect a different kind of taste (black jelly bean kinda)We had the mussels to start which were fantastic Im a huge Au Poivres fan and this was right up there with the best I've ever had.

After waiting 30 minutes to be sat for an 8:30 reservation we ordered a few starters, foie gras mousse the size of a golf ball, steak tartare which had absolutely no seasoning at all and a full board of cheese and charcuterie which we had to ask for bread for, not sure how they expected us to eat it. The sommelier automatically tried to sell us the very expensive bottles of wine, we settled on a Rioja for 85$ which was the nicest part of the meal. after such a disappointing start we decided not to have main causes, settled the bill and moved to another establishment.

Last time I came, the weather was nice so we sat outside. Since it is too cold for outdoor seating now, we were given a great seat in the balcony overlooking the beauty of the restaurant. For our appetizers, we ordered the escargot and the foie gras. The escargot came out piping hot and stayed hot until our last bite. It was extremely flavorful and enjoyable. The foie gras mousse was very interesting. I never really liked foie gras to begin with but I thought it was made well here and came with perfectly toasted bread. The prize winning dish and highlight of our meal is the Cote De Boeuf Pour Deux (40 oz tomahawk rib-eye with roasted bone marrow). The steak was very juicy and cooked in an amazing sauce. The bone marrow could use a tad less salt but nonetheless, every bite was delicious. The portion is quite hefty for two people so we almost had trouble finishing it. Although we were stuffed, we wanted to try their desserts again and decided to share the Crepe Suzette. The crepe consisted of the perfect level of sweetness and went very well with the scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Though without the outdoor seatings, their decors inside felt welcoming and well lit. I had a reservation at 6:30, showed up a little late but was seated right away. Our waiter, Drago (sp) was wonderful and attentive. I spilled a little sauce on the table, he immediately came over and placed a new tablecloth on top to cover the stain. He helped us arrange our drinks so our food would fit (kudos) for paying attention to great details. I requested a fruity cocktail with little alcohol and hubby wanted a Moscow Mule, those aren't on the menu, but Drago made it happen for us!  that made me a happy camper for sure.

I love foie gras and this dish did not disappoint. They provided more toast to supplement than they did the first visit (almost like they knew doe).

I'd recommend adding freshly ground pepper to the dish! ~$24 (We actually made some stains from the foie gras appetizer on the tablecloth and the waiter come by and laid another layer on top to cover it!)I got the special of the night on Monday which was the 2 lb lobster. I def underestimated the size of it. you get a whole lobster basically, including the 2 claws which they provide the tools for.

We were will taken care of from the beginning of the meal till the end (shout out to our server Mickey for being awesome and sining me Happy Birthday not once, but twice). Now on to the food:Appetizers:Steak tartare- The steak meat was so fresh and tender.Foie gras mousse- (my favorite appetizer of the night) The mousse was so smooth and the red wine port sauce paired so well with it. I really wanted to be greedy and eat the whole plate to myself.Escargots- Super buttery with a hint of garlic and lemon.French Onion Soup- The cheese was nice and gooey and the soup was perfect... not too salty like some places.Main Entree: when you come here you have to order one of their steaksButcher Block- dry-aged filet mignon, hanger steak, and New York strip served on two butchers block with a selection of house sauces. This is great for a large group because you get to try a variety of different cuts.Tomahawk Rib-eye (for two) This was my favorite steak. It has the right amount of fat which makes it super juicy and gives it that rich beefy taste. I would most definitely re-order this steak again.Rack of Lamb- Since we already order several beef steaks, we thought we would switch it up and order the lamb. It was nice and pink in the center and did not have that gamey taste at all. Sides: fries (of course you have to get it), gratin, and ratatouille Dessert:Can't end a birthday dinner without something sweet even though we were super stuffed. We got the creme brûlée, profiteroles, and chocolate mousse, which each one was delish!Overall, this was an amazing meal and would recommend my friends to eat here. Thank you Boucherie for making my dinner an awesome dining experience.",-5.312,0.3697214076246334

I was definitely a tad doubtful if I picked the right place for our special day but given our spur of the moment wedding and no time to find another place we went here. ...and Thank God we did. This is the perfect date-y place. Candles and everything!! Our server Mickey was awesome to say the least. We were seated on the Mezzanine overlooking the bar and kitchen and rest of this cute restaurant. Could not have asked for a better table. Their bar is famous for absinthe cocktails so we went for it. Both the cocktails were delicious and flavors complimented each other well. They were not sickeningly sweet which is a major bum at most places. They bring out complimentary baguette and some French bread along with charcuterie. For the appetizers, we took their escargot and stuffed quail (the quail mainly because I was curious). The snails come out sizzling hot in a garlic butter thing. It melts in your mouth (well, almost, you don't want your snails to be goo anyway). The quail was stuffed with meat (i think) and raisins etc. Overall it had a hint of sweetness and a burst of other flavors. Nicely roasted after that and on a bed of chutney. PERFECT! For the main course, I had the rack of lamb while my guy had the pork chop. I would not change anything about the lamb. Perfectly cooked till medium rare. The bed of vegetables was just cooked right. Scrumptious. If I could order again after going back in time (LOL) I would not order their pork chop. It was a little bland in the middle for me. The veggies and chutney were pretty tasty however. I asked for the crepe suzette as our dessert and again they hit bull's eye with it. I will definitely go back here to celebrate something else :)",-5.312,0.25958994708994715

446,2017-11-11,1.0,I filed a complaint with the NY Department of Health about Boucherie. This place is covered in grease and it is not safe. The floors and stair steps are so slick. It's like you're ice skating. Grease everywhere. My steak was overcooked and tasted like bacon. Rest of the food greasy. Even salad was greasy. When you first walk in the floor is so slick. Let alone the stairs. It's a safety hazard. My poor wife slipped down the stairs and got hurtAsk any of the poor waiters there. They know how hazardous it isDo not go here. So many other good places in the West Village. Go to Balthazar or Minetta if that's the vibe you're looking for.  This place is trying hard but everything falls way short.They need to replace the flooring and deep clean every day to cut all the grease on the floor.

I also love the open kitchens so that you can watch the chefs prepare the meals. The restaurant is very spacious and has multiple floors that can accommodate large parties without feeling too tight or getting too loud. The food was exceptional as well. We got the stuffed quail appetizer, the duck leg, rack of lamb, and profiteroles. The stuffed quail might have been my favorite part of the meal- the balsamic glaze was amazing. The only callout that I have is that the duck could have been a little more flavorful. I was told that the lamb was perfect and I also highly recommend the profiteroles for dessert.

449,2017-11-07,5.0,"Brunch at Boucherie, it has a certain ring to it doesn't it? This French brasserie has perfect brunch ambience: soaring ceilings and windows, mostly calm with a little hustle and bustle, and classic brasserie decor.Although Boucherie may allude to meat/steaks, their brunch fare was excellent as well. Pain perdu is a familiar comforting french toast, the bread having soaked up just enough eggy richness, seared to a light crisp exterior, topped with plenty of fresh berries. The Croque Madame was amazing, with really great (huge) slices of bread and the perfect ratio of sauce/bread/ham/cheese. It's hearty and filling but not overly rich. The eggs norwegian is a classic of course, perfectly poached eggs with chewy english muffin and great lox. For anyone going carb-free, the eggs florentine are a great option; just so you know, this does not come with any bread but you could always enjoy with the free bread basket! The artichokes were a nice addition. Pommes frites are a must, fluffy pillowy interior and extra crisp exterior. Order some to share - they are so addictive! Don't miss out on dessert! The lovely manager Zorica sent us some creme brulee and mousse au chocolat, both very classic and both perfectly smooth and creamy, not too sweet. At this point we were all stuffed, but we cleaned the plates.  The service was excellent - much friendlier, attentive, and helpful. A smile goes a long way! Highly recommend. It's perfect for a date as well as a group meals, even with the parents as a a great mid-range price option.

The butcher block can probably feed up to 4 people or more. It was huge and offered a variety of meats. They were all absolutely amazing and tasted delicious!

The manager, Zorica, reached out to me and got me and my husband on the books for a 7pm reservation on a Saturday night.  I had passed Boucherie many times and had it on my list for an upcoming date night, so I was super excited to check it out.  From the moment we walked in, the service was outstanding.  We were greeted by Zorica herself and taken to a table that overlooked the dining area.  One of the best seats in the place.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated and feels very French, almost as if you are no longer in NYC.  What we ordered:-Provence Martini:  This drink was amazing.  Very interesting flavors, like nothing I'd tasted before.  A+.-Boucherie Sazerac:  Husband was equally pleased. :)-Moules Basquaises:  Very delicious and fresh mussels in a heavenly broth.  The chorizo portion was large and delicious.-Bordeaux:  Recommended by the waiter to pair with the steaks.-Filet de Boeuf:  We thankfully both got the filet because it was AMAZING.  Honestly could be the best filet that I have ever had.  Certainly the most tender!  The truffle butter was a delicious addition and it was served with sautéed spinach and onions.  This dish was very impressive.-Profiteroles:  3 large profiteroles with delicious sauces and ice cream.  I want to try the creme brûlée next!-Bailey's on the rocks:  Hard to mess this up but they did give me a great pour!-Port:  Unsure which port the husband got but it was delicious!Towards the end of our meal another manager came by to see how the experience had been.  He was very nice and even gave us a complimentary Boucherie book which now sits on our coffee table at home.  Our experience was honestly one of the best we have had in NYC and we eat out A LOT.  While I know we received stellar service because we were asked to dine, I think the experience is likely pretty standard based on what we observed while eating.

Food was great (see below for more detail) but highlight was definitely the service. From the restaurant manager down to the wait staff, everyone was really prompt/attentive and fun. In terms of the food- We ordered heavier entrees so went with salad for apps to balance it out in theory. Otherwise would normally had tried the foie gras or escargot. Expected the apps to be small but salads were actually really substantial! I got the salade d'auvergne which was really refreshing. Perfect amount of viniagrette so that it didn't feel too heavy. The little bit of sweetness from the apple and candied walnuts were welcome as well. I actually also enjoyed the Brussels sprouts salad my boyfriend ordered, but it's definitely heartier (warm, with a really well-executed slightly-runny egg on top). We are not big eaters so were already a little full going into the entrees...of which are also pretty substantial. The steak we got was amazing (they recommended it). It was the faux filet bercy (dry-aged bone-in ny strip) - medium rare. Was the highlight of our dinner! And we took some to go (what we couldn't finish); still good the next day. The other entree Pot eu Feu has a beautiful presentation and portions were generous. However, it was just a little too salty for my taste (will go with steak next time, but was worth a try given the colder weather that night). I at least have a second stomach for dessert, and we got some off menu (for now) item - think it was pistachio ice cream which they cover in a chocolate sauce/shell at your table.

Our waiter, Micky/Mickey/Miki/Micki???, had the best eyebrows in the gig and brought his A-game on when it came to remembering all our appetizers, add-ons, and entrees. As we delve into an area of great controversy, and you may whole-heartedly disagree, I still find the hidden star of this restaurant to be their 'Profiteroles'. The warm and crispy puff sandwiching a decadent and cold vanilla bean scoop, drizzled with dark chocolate...every bite a warm and fuzzy bliss.I didn't order steak at my pevious visit and considering it's what they're known for, we ordered the YOLO-est meal possible. The 'Butcher Block' with its three different cuts, was a 3-lb meat fest. I highly recommend this spread for larger parties because you get to enjoy the best bits of beef. If you prefer a lighter cut and something less smoky in flavor, the 'Côte de Bœf Pour Deux' comes highly recommended. All this protein glory was more than enough for our party of 5.All I have to say is, GET THE 'Pommes Frites' and 'Gratin de Pommes de Terre'; Boucherie knows how to cook their potatoes!The 'Anti Douleur' was a winner as a cocktail and slayed as a mocktail. The pineapple coconuttiness was a beautiful blend and my favorite kind of combo. Keep those mocktails coming.See you soon, Boucherie.

We opted for a ""Provence martini"" with lavender, vodka & absinthe, and the house Sazerac: whiskey, absinthe, and Peychaud's bitters.    There were lots of rich French appetizers; pate, escargots, etc., but we preferred a couple of nice green salads, one with arugula, the other brussels sprouts, each with a nice tangy dressing.    Our entrees were cod and steak au poivre, each cooked perfectly. I like it medium-rare, and there was lots of pink in the middle, so that's good. It came with delicious fries, but I couldn't finish them all.   We ended sharing a chocolate mousse, then got coffees. The coffees came in the French manner, after the dessert.

The stuffed quail was cooked very well, especially the bits around the bone that has caramelized.For my main, I got the veal porterhouse and my boyfriend got the filet mignon both cooked to medium rare. Of the two, I actually preferred the filet. It was so tender, juicy and flavorful. The veal porterhouse was good and I definitely loved the soaked sweetbread and mushrooms that came with it, but the steak was a little too dry.For dessert, we shared the creme brûlée which was the highlight of the meal.

I just prefer people to be honest and not to tell me that the food will now be out in 5 minutes (after retaking my order) when it actually takes 15 minutes to make. In total this means, I waited about an hour and fifteen minutes for my meal. Anyways, I won't harp on this fact but it did effect the overall experience.

At first I wasn't too impress about the escargot, but it grew on me and I couldn't stop eating. The foie gras was light but flavorful. Sometimes I find foie gras too heavy but this was just right. Amazing bread! We then shared the cote de boeuf. The bone marrow was to die for. We had two full bones of it and of course delicious meat. As sides we got the gratin and French fries. Gratin was perfectly done. We couldn't finish everything and had it to go. Ended the meal with the creme bruele and profiteroles. I love the latter so much almost licked the plate! The only small thing is please restock your tea bags =)Great attentive service. Not too much where it is intrusive but water is always filled. Got a butcher book signed by the chef. What a way to end the dinner!Definitely coming back to try other dishes as they are very authentic. Great for big or small groups.",3.8083333333333336,0.29150793650793655

474,2017-10-24,5.0,"Boucherie is a charming restaurant in the heart of the West Village, but with a feeling as though you are right in the middle of Paris. This space used to be a jazz bar a few years ago, and was entirely redone to become a well executed french restaurant. The food is delicious (try the filet mignon with truffle butter!) and the wine is excellent. The sommelier was very helpful in selecting a glass of wine to pair with our meal, and our server was great. I have a soft spot in my heart for good french restaurants, and this place definitely fits the bill. I still have to try the tarte tatin when I am eating carbs again :-), so we will be back!",18.92264150943396,0.31785714285714284
475,2017-10-20,5.0,"We came to Boucherie for dinner last weekend, and even though I've walked by this part of 7th Avenue many times while I have been living in Manhattan, it never occurred to me to stop by here for a meal. With a wide-open interior with a roof that harkens to something a bit more hipster you'd find over the East River, the old-school tiled floor and the close wooden table seating speaks to the Parisian influence that infuses Boucherie, and it's a nice touch between the Old World ambiance with a very muted New World sensibility. We were seated on the raised seating area above the main floor, giving us a nice view of the dining area, the open kitchen (where there is counter seating) and the retro-style bar. Service was quick but not too prompt, allowing us to soak in the setting and the ambiance between bites. The drink menu is alright - short on the beers (which is more of an American obsession anyways), but with an extensive wine list (I didn't sample) and delicious cocktails (I really enjoyed the citrus-infused drink over crushed ice that I had).The food, probably unsurprisingly, tilts towards classical French, but it's easy to say with a straight face that the food is absolutely divine here. The kitchen doesn't go out of its way to do anything too fancy, but the simplicity and the deliciousness of the execution would no doubt impress even those back in France. We started off sharing two appetizers - the foie gras and the steak tartare. The bread with the tartare was a bit too crunchy for my liking, but I enjoyed the moistness of the tartare (sometimes I have found European tartares to be more on the drier side) and the fulsome flavor of the meat. The foie came as a (nearly) cone-shaped terrine, and wow was it good - very creamy, particularly accentuated when paired with the warm, soft brioche slices it was served with. I really liked the sweetened / pickled onions it came with, as both the sweetness and bitterness came through, serving a dual purpose with only one additional food item. The mains, arguably, were even better. You can order off the regular menu or the specials; I kept it simple: center-cut filet done medium, with a thin, circular slice of truffle butter that melted all over the top. What a steak - the truffle melted into the meat makes for a divinely delicious bite each time, and the perfect crisp on the steak gave it a nice texture that belied just how succulent and juicy each bite was. My wife's rack of lamb was also quite good - not the best preparation I have had, and at medium-rare, it seemed a little undercooked IMO - but the flavor was still very good. We finished off our meal with the chocolate mousse, which was a bit of a heavy choice but was creamy and delicious, especially with the dense dollop of whipped cream on the top.Now that I know what Boucherie holds, I definitely plan on coming back again. The ambiance is really nice - especially when the windows are open (that season is coming to an end soon, unfortunately), and the food is fantastic, with the meats clearly done at a very high level. Worth an initial visit, and undoubtedly several repeats more in the future.",2.9333333333333336,0.2605421122994653
476,2017-10-17,5.0,"That was one of our favorite meals while working in NY this year. The service was impeccable, from the greeting, through the sommelier to the table servers, they were helpful, courteous and kind. Then the food came. Bread, butter and salad perfection. My friend got the cod, a brilliant dish. And my steak frites were amazing.  The wine selection was varied and deep.  We'll be back.",0.9,0.49375
477,2017-10-16,5.0,"After an amazing dining experience at Olio e Piú, the sister restaurant of Boucherie, I was eager to try this one, especially having had it on my list for quite some time. Just like Olio, the experience was excellent. The restaurant itself is beautiful, with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, very attentive and polite staff and delicious food/drinks.Before the appetizers even came out, we were given a bread basket with a side of olive oil, olives, peppers, prosciutto and onions (free of charge) - amazing! For appetizer, we started with the cauliflower soup which was very tasty. This was the special of the night but really should be on the menu to stay! For main we had an order of the steak frites and the truffle/mushroom ravioli. Both were phenomenal. The steak was extremely tasty, with an excellent sauce and fries on the side. The ravioli was covered in truffle shavings - enough said! Finally, for dessert we had the chocolate mousse. Must get. As for drinks, the wine and cocktail selection was very extensive with plenty of options for whatever you feel.Definitely a must try restaurant and when you're done here, try Olio e Piú.",6.844444444444446,0.41493386243386243
478,2017-10-15,5.0,"So after my unfortunate experience, I was contacted by the manager who apologized profusely on behalf of the server. I get it; not everyone is cognizant of racial microagressions, so I guess I'm just glad he would know better for the future, when another group of vaguely asian girls come into the restaurant.I came back for dinner, and it's still just as pretty as it is for brunch. We were seated on the upper level, and the space really is beautiful and perfect for a date night. We had a couple of cocktails; I can't recall the names, but I had an absinthe-based one that I loved. Strongly recommend.For food, we ordered the escargot and scallops as starters, and they were both delicious. The escargot was buttery, garlicky, and decadent. My friend and I couldn't help but dip our bread into the sauce, it was so delicious. The scallops were fresh and cooked perfectly. Solid choices.We then had the steak tartare and their cut of the week. The steak tartar was by far our favorite dish. It was different from other kinds that I had; not as oily and rich, but light and refreshing. The meat melted in our mouths; we ordered the full serving, which was a very smart decision. The cut of the week was a little undercooked (ordered it medium rare, but came out a tiny bit rarer than preferred), but still good. I would opt for the porterhouse or tomahawk with bone marrow (if you're in a bigger group) next time, which are regularly on their menu. We had the creme brulee for dessert, and it tasted exactly like how a creme brulee should taste. Nothing crazy innovative, but sometimes, that's not what you need. I had a much better experience this time around, and would recommend this place for a night out. Wonderful ambiance and stellar french food.",17.328571428571426,0.2852411477411477
479,2017-10-15,5.0,"UPDATE- October 14,2017. We were invited back by the manager and decided to go for our anniversary. This was a very different experience. They seem like a well oiled machine now.  The food was always outstanding and last night they did not disappoint. We were asked where we would like to sit and we chose outside (it was beautiful out and most people were outside). Our waiter Martin was very attentive, as was the busboy. He was also well versed in the food and the pairings of side dishes and wines. His suggestions were perfect. The filet mignon and New York strip were ridiculously good. We gave them another chance and we are so glad we did.

480,2017-10-13,4.0,"This place is beautiful, classy and romantic, but a bit loud inside. I love the decor. The waiters were great- always refilling; food took a little while to make. Pouple Provencal ($21)- 3.5/5 This was good but not as good as Peach Shrimp & Crab restaurant. I think the preparation is quite similar. However, this is one of the biggest ""baby"" octopus I've had by far. I usually don't like baby octopus only big ones. Cabillaud Roti ($35)- 4/5 This was the seared cod. Overall the cod was a bit flavorless but with the sauce and everything it was much better. The tomatoes were alright, I don't think they're organic though and I only like organic tomatoes. The zucchini and yellow squash was actually delicious, and I'm usually not a big fan of these two veggies. Saumon a L'unilateral ($31)- 3.5/5 We asked for well done and of course they bring it back raw. So we sent it back and it was much better the second time. The salmon was okay, nothing mind blowing. It was a really simple dish. Pommes Frites ($10)- 4/5 Great fries that they serve with ketchup. Portion is decent but the price is sorta ridiculous, $10 for fries.",10.757142857142856,0.1875827129859388

482,2017-10-12,5.0,"I've always passed by this restaurant, so I was excited to try it with my friends. The place was clean and sleek. You could tell they had nice ambience as you entered. The inside has a huge mirror which makes the place look very large, not crowded (probably because slightly higher end), and very clean while maintaining the classy, authentic French resto look.My friends and I ended up choosing Butcher's Block which includes three steaks and bone marrow. We ordered some sides and a bottle of wine. They service was very professional and attentive. After serving, they kept the wine to keep the temperature. We appetizers were very good. We got Cesar salad, beet salad, and escargot -- all very fresh and tasty. The steak platter was exquisite. The presentation was very mouthwatering and exciting! It was three types of rare-medium steaks sliced, two very thick bone marrow, and two delicious sides (mushroom medley and pomme gratis/potatoes). We got another bottle of wine.We were so full and happy with the food and service and good company, and then to make it even better, they came over and surprised us with two desserts, creme brulee, and chocolate mouse.

483,2017-10-11,4.0,"The decor of this place is gorgeous! It is a perfect setting for an intimate dinner date. My friend and took our other friend, the Birthday Girl out for a treat here. Excellent service started upon arrival! Our hostess, Cynthia :) was very welcoming and friendly! Complimentary bread and butter with olives, eggplant, artichoke in olive oil and topped with cured meat. The butter was sooo good! For appetizers, we started with the Mousse De Foie Gras and the Steak Tartare. Mousse De Foie Gras had foie gras, onions, and red wine reduction sauce to go with it. This dish is no small deal, it was really good! I loved the flavors of the red wine reduction. I really enjoyed the flavors coming together as I spread it on top of the bread. Steak Tartare came with a quail egg yolk to mix it in. The meat was mixed with parsley, shallots, and capers. It was flavorful. Between these two, I liked the Mousse De Foie Gras a bit better. We got the Saumon a L'unilateral which is a grilled salmon dish with asparagus and baby spinach. This was my favorite entree. I loved how perfectly seasoned the salmon was and it was cooked to perfection in medium rare as we requested. Salmon was really tender as well. Next, we had the Duck Confit with truffle potatoes. I liked the crispy pieces of duck skin along with the field greens that it came with. We also got the Steak & Frites. This was a sirloin piece with peppercorn sauce with a side of frites which were crispy on the outside and tasted a bit like mashed potatoes on the inside. In my opinion, I think the pomme frites resembles Burger King fries and I mean it in a positive way! Creme Brulee was awesome! It is one of my favorite desserts and I am a harsh critic. The version here is almost perfect in texture. The custard was so soft but a bit liquid-y and it is not overly sweet. Caramelized sugar top was perfect, not too hard and not too soft neither. This is probably my second favorite in NYC. As I mentioned above, service is excellent here! The staff members are there to refill our water and bread basket almost immediately. They were prompt in serving all dishes in a timely manner. Reservation process was simple and easy online via Yelp or OpenTable. Definitely will be back for the outdoor seating before it gets cold!",14.778571428571428,0.32714015151515147
484,2017-10-08,5.0,"As the French would say, everything was parfait!Came here to celebrate our anniversary on a Saturday evening. I'd recommend making a reservation ahead of time, just to be safe and definitely if you have a large group. There's seating both inside and outside, extremely spacious and clean. Moreover, decor is tastefully done with wooden tables, high ceiling and just the right amount of plants scattered around. We sat on the booth, right by the walk-through windows where some diners were seated outside. It was the perfect spot to watch the sunset while enjoying our meal. They also have a very extensive and impressive bar, drinks beautifully laid out against their large mirror on the wall that are lined with white tiles. There's a romantic vibe to the restaurant, especially during the evening with their hanging lights, vintage French posters, candles and music softly playing in the background.First up, drinks. I asked our server to surprise us with virgin beverages. To my surprise, he showed up with refreshing, fruity drinks mixed with pineapples, coconut and oranges. Loved it. There's also complimentary bread, butter and a small plate of prosciutto, an olive, mushrooms and a tuna stuffed tomato. We munched on this while waiting for our appetizers, which included the escargot and steak tartare. Before I delve in any further with the apps, I want to give a shoutout to the tuna stuffed tomato. I think it deserves some recognition because it was bomb dot com. Just cut it up, put it on top of your bread and take a bite. You'll know exactly what I mean.Escargot ($21): Girrrrrl. Talk about tender, chewy, buttery goodness. It comes out sizzlin' hot with generous amount of snails in each pod, all swimming in butter. Take that complementary bread you just got earlier, dip it in that melted butter, scoop the seasoning from a pod and spread it on the bread. Now add a snail on top and voila! You'll find yourself with your eyes closed and a grin on your face. I just kept shaking my head left and right while chewing and yes, with my eyes closed just savoring each bite. Magnifique! Would order again, fasho.Steak Tartare ($21/$27): It was perfectly seasoned, diced and beautifully presented with a quail egg on top, three pieces of crunchy toast and leafy greens dressed in some sort of a vinaigrette that complemented perfectly with flavors of salty and sour. I'd recommend putting a layer of the leafy greens on the toast and spreading a generous amount of the tartare for that perfect bite.For the main dish, we got the cut of the week--a 16 oz 120 days dry-aged Pat LaFrieda bone in New York strip ($64). Why, isn't that a mouthful. Yes, your mouth will literally be full of of that smokiness and magic spice that they smothered on that steak. A perfect medium rare, this will put fireworks in your mouth. The other main dish, filet mignon (also in medium rare) with truffle butter ($48) was pure magic. Take a piece of the mignon and stab a slice of their onion bulb with a bit of spinach with your fork and you'll be on the verge of tears. Tears of joy, that is.We got two desserts, Semifredo ($12) and Creme Bruelee ($10). Our server told us that it was the first day they were having semifredo as their dessert special, just trying it out to see if they want to put it on their main dessert menu. I'd say yes please. The main flavors were crushed pistachio mixed with the semi-frozen whipped cream over a layer of brownie and hot fudge poured on top. I noticed there were six main desserts on the menu (creme bruelee, cream puff, tarte tatin, chocolate mousse, crepes suzette, ice cream/sorbet selection) and the only option for chocolate lovers would be the mousse. Well, I got good news for you. Get their semifredo and you won't be disappointed. The server will pour hot fudge over it as your mouth waters in anticipation. You'll be surprised that your mouth is even watering after all the apps and main dish you just inhaled. As for the creme bruelee, it's a classic. Presented beautifully with fresh raspberries and strawberries, it has the perfect layer of hard caramel on top--not too thick or thin. Both desserts were a sizable portion and I think we would've been fine with ordering just one, only because we were extremely stuffed at this point. Nonetheless, I'm so glad we tried both despite all the waddling that occurred thereafter.Not sure you can tell by now (if you read this far, gimme a pound) but I'm a fan. Their meats are on point. I'd get their escargot and filet mignon again in a heartbeat--pretty sure I'm going to dream about them. Service is exceptional. The manager checked in on us and we felt cared for throughout the entire course of our meal. Also, I can't remember the last time I spent over two hours at a restaurant. We literally walked in during daylight and saw the sunset until it was pitch dark outside.Overall, need I say more? This is one of the best French restaurants I've been to and you can bet that I'll be back.",21.400000000000006,0.24897347333517558
485,2017-10-07,5.0,"Several very amazing things happened here when my bf and I came to eat dinner last night:1) BF hates hates hates drinking. He stays trying tho. He tries one cocktail every time we go out, inevitably hates it halfway through, and enlists me to finish it (np love!). Last night he orders the Anti Doleour, takes two sips, and announces that he hates it -- he learned last night that he doesn't like rum or absinthe. I offer up my own drink as I normally do, which in this case is the Belle Epoque. I fully expect him to hate it and leave both drinks for me, like usual. (We obviously have a great relationship; I always have a designated driver and he always has a garbage dump of a gf to happily take all his leftovers.*) Imagine my surprise when his face lights up and says it's the best drink he's ever had. He tells me it tastes like lemonade but way better. Of course it's better! It has alcohol! And of course I know it's better! That was mine! Seriously considering giving this establishment 1 star for having such amazing drinks that my alcohol-hating boyfriend drank a whole entire cocktail on his own. Last night I was torn between celebrating because now I know where to take him if I want someone to drink with, and lamenting my lost Belle Epoque.2) BF is the pickiest eater in the world. Even at the best restaurants he always has something to say about the food. He tentatively agreed to try the escargot with me. When it arrived, he hesitated to try it. When he took a bite, he paused, looked at me, and just nodded his head. It was as if he suddenly understood all the secrets in the known universe, thanks to these snails.3) BF is the pickiest eater in the world. Even at the best steak restaurants he always has something to say about the steak. It's always too tough, too overcooked for his taste, too undercooked for his taste (is there such a thing?), unseasoned, too seasoned, too this, or too that. I was nervous when he picked the steak frites. I chose the restaurant and hyped the steak up so much that I worried it wouldn't be to his standards. But believe me when I say that in all the years I've known him I've never seen him as quiet as when he was eating that steak. It must've been good? I'm not sure, he couldn't even get a word out.4) BF is not a big dessert person. I, on the other hand, have a huge sweet tooth. For dessert, we ordered the profiteroles. We were told that it came with three of them to an order, so we placed 2 orders of profiteroles because three didn't sound like enough. We were horribly wrong. A single order would have been enough for two people to share. After we got our two plates each with three very healthy sized profiteroles, we stared at each other. What the heck were we going to do with all these profiteroles?? We won't even be able to finish them! we said. We wasted money on dessert we won't eat! but, jk we both wiped our plates clean. Even the Boy Who Hates Chocolate finished every last bite.5) We were the only people of color in the restaurant that night, as far as we could tell, at least for the 1.5hrs we were there. Normally this makes us uncomfortable and worry that we might be treated differently. It can and has happened, unfortunately, more times and more often than we'd like to admit. But we very quickly realized that Boucherie is not one of these places, and by the end of the meal the idea that it ever could be was very silly and ridiculous. The service the entire night was the best I've ever experienced in a restaurant before in my life. A little bit of condensation from my drink left the tiniest drop of water on the table and when we were being given our forks and steak knives, it was wiped away immediately. How did our server even see it was there? I don't know, I don't care, I love him and his meticulous attention to tiny water rings and bread crumbs. BF who???We were only 10 minutes into our meal before we started planning our next one at Boucherie.",18.46875,0.18394542291802565

We picked the same week (Wed) night to make a fair comparison.  Unlike the previous visit, the restaurant was rather full, and the music was subdued.  We started with a Caesar Salad and the Onion Soup.....classic dishes which did not disappoint.  We both had the Poulet Roti, which again is classic and was juicy and crispy.  My husband substituted the mash potatoes for the French Fries, which again was crispy on the outside and smooth and creamy on the inside.  For dessert we shared a Profiterole....very good.  Also, the service was excellent.  Based on our second visit, our first visit was an off night, and I retract my former review and would recommend anyone visit this for an excellent French Bistro meal.",15.420833333333334,0.27280701754385966

Also, how can anyone pass up crunchy fries? Everyone seems to love the creme brulee here and I must agree. The top of the brulee had the perfect crunch.

491,2017-10-03,5.0,"Came here with a friend for dinner last night. Overall, the food and service were all amazing. My only complaint is that I didn't really feel a French twist on the food, however, in no way does that take away from the quality. We ordereed a salade de choux de buxelles - basically a brussel sprout salad. Let me tell you, those were the best brussel sprouts I've ever had. It was mixed with some other greens, but it was just infused with such flavor, I would say that this is a must get. We also ordered the saint jacques a la provencale - or basically scallops. My complaint, is that there wasn't enough (although I was extremely full by the end of the meal, so maybe it was). It comes with four LARGE half pieces of scallops that were bursting with flavor. They were cooked to perfection and were extremely tender and just melted in your mouth. It also came with some kind of roasted tomato/pepper combo that was just to die for. For our actual entrees we got the steak frites. The steak was seared to perfection and was perfectly cooked. I loved the flavor on it. And man oh man, the fries! I could eat those all day! We also got the lamb chops. Personally, I liked the steak a lot more. The lamb chops were a bit balsamic for my taste, but my friend said that she loved the lamb more. Either way, both entrees were amazing. The service here was also great. Almost too great! At any time there was always someone at our table, refilling our water, wiping away crumbs etc. The servers are also extremely friendly and loved to make jokes with us, especially when my friend was taking pictures of the food. Overall, a great place to come. If you're trying to save money, a good recommendation I would have is maybe try to come and split a bunch of appetizers. Man those dishes were so good.

494,2017-10-02,2.0,"I first discovered Boucherie via their beautiful food photography on Instagram!  This past Saturday the stars aligned: I had a free night and was craving steak!  We were warmly greeted upon our admittedly very late arrival, and were quickly seated upstairs.  We placed our food order: brussels sprout salad and the 16 oz dry aged bone in strip with a side of au poivre sauce and fries.  The sommelier recommended a fantastic Bordeaux, and we were off to a great start!  At this point I requested a new table as my chair was over a loose floorboard and was really uncomfortable every time someone walked by. The manager kindly reseated us downstairs at a fantastic table.They brought over a small complimentary aperitivo along with the bread.  Unfortunately as I was eating an olive, I found a very long piece of hair.  I eat out often and understand that these things happen from time to time, so we decide to carry on.  The salad arrived overdressed and personally I found it uninspired.   The steak disappointingly arrived cold, and the au poivre sauce was so sweet I had to ask the waiter if this was indeed the correct sauce.  Upon finishing our steak, the waiter informed they were sending out some complimentary desserts (which was very nice of them). The creme brule was good, however the profiteroles were amazing! The service during our visit, while polite, was very disorganized.  Our initial waiter did not ask how we we wanted the steak prepared, and was confused when we asked.  We had to ask several times for extra plates as we were sharing, and upon being informed of desserts we weren't asked if we wanted coffee or anything else.  The sommelier told us the wine was ""Eighty-something,"" but was $90 on the check.  Individually I could probably look past everything except for the steak; there are just way too many great bistros/steakhouses in NYC where bad steak at this price point is just not acceptable. I really wanted to love Boucherie, unfortunately it just doesn't deliver.  The positives: great looking venue (take a moment to appreciate the mirrors with beautiful rounded edges), the wine was amazing as were the profiteroles!",6.325,0.16113571613571612
495,2017-10-01,5.0,"A stellar meal at Boucherie on a Saturday night. Promptly seated a table overlooking the restaurant and kitchens, we were pleasantly greeted by the somm and our waiter. Both steaks, the 120 day dry aged NY strip and Filet were excellently prepared. The 120 day dry aged strip presented as the best strip steak I've had and the third best steak overall I had coming in behind Carnevino (Vegas, 270 day riserva ribeye) and RPM Steak (Chicago, 90 day ribeye). Both steaks ordered and delivered medium rare with an excellent wood fired crust. Wish I had more details on the wood fired cooking process as this produced an awesome product. Highly recommended.",6.378571428571428,0.3652941176470588
496,2017-10-01,5.0,Went here for brunch with some friends and my dog - Amazingly cute restaurant with a great atmosphere. Food was delicious and huge portions. I got the avocado toast and asked for no eggs so they made me extra toast to be fair - how incredible is that? i've never heard of a restaurant compensating a dish by adding more if you deduct something. the waitress was so sweet and accommodating - will definitely be going back!,6.378571428571428,0.46818181818181814
497,2017-10-01,5.0,"Boucherie is an authentic French restaurant with beautiful interiors and high ceilings. Located in the heart of West Village with ample street parking and public transportation options. Even offers happy hour at the bar for cocktail and wine selections. Opened in December 2016, Boucherie is a great addition to the eclectic food scene in West Village. I've had French cuisine a few times, but never have been impressed. Often times, it is too salty or buttery. Boucherie is neither of those and leaves a positive, lasting impression. Recommend for date nights or even company dinners - ample seating space!APPS*Octopus: Cooked so well! Generous portions of octopus prepared amazingly in a marinara type sauce. Whole chunks of tomato well balances the octopus. The octopus melts in your mouth - so heavenly. *Scallop: more memorable than expected. Recommended by our server. Very juicy and tender scallops with delicious garlic sauce with a kick of spicyness to it. The tomato sauce balances the scallops wonderfully. Definitely recommend if you are looking for a seafood app. ENTREES*120days dry aged NY strip (cut of the week): ONE OF THE BEST STEAKS. Dinosaur is extremely picky with his steak and he LOVED this. Arguably the best NY strip we had. You know when steak has been properly aged when you put it in your mouth and that flavor of smokiness and spice just lingers in your mouth. This is exactly that. Very, very impressed. I wish the high end steak specialty restaurants would learn from Boucherie in how they age their steaks. Two thumbs up! *Veal porterhouse: another melt in my mouth cut. Cooked perfectly per my request 'medium' porterhouse comprised of half filet mignon and half NY strip. Comes with a generous portion, but not overwhelmingly huge. Seasoning was perfect and I appreciated that it was not salty! Comes with enokie demi glaze on the side, which adds bit of more flavor and makes this dish special in the 'Boucherie' way. DESSERT*Profiteroles: my goodness, what a perfect way to end our meal. For those are new to profiteroles, it is a creme-puff filled with various fillings. Boucherie fills it with vanilla ice cream and tops it off chocolate syrup. The pastry is very airy, not too dense. The ice cream and chocolate syrup is well balanced, not overly sweet. Just when I thought the night cannot get any better after that steak, Boucherie's profiteroles amazed us.Overall, fantastic experience from the Boucherie team. Very impressive range of food from seafood to meats with innovative cocktail selections. Service is also top notch as our waiter stopped by many times to make sure we are having a true Boucherie night. Definitely give Boucherie a chance - you will not be disappointed!",6.378571428571428,0.34305962219598585
498,2017-09-29,5.0,"Visited for the 1st time since opening night. This time we came back to try another meat dish. Last time the food was delicious and this time around it was even better!  I still can't get over how beautiful the interior is! We started off with French onion soup - can't get any more classic than this. We also had the Poulpe Provencale (baby octopus with potatoes, tomatoes & olives). It's very flavorful & tender. For entree: Don't miss out on the Steak Frites Au Poivre (it's an amazing Pat LaFrieda NY strip with a delicious peppercorn cream sauce with French fries) for $45. We also tried the 16 oz 120 days dry aged Pat LaFrieda bone-in NY strip for $64.  Both meats were cooked medium rare to perfection! They were surely fine pieces of meat.To end the night, we shared the creme brûlée. You really can't go wrong with this one if you don't know what to choose!Definitely will come back to try other dishes. The service was impeccable as well.",6.608333333333333,0.29208333333333336
499,2017-09-29,5.0,"Came back here to try Boucherie again, at the invitation of the manager, and I must say, this experience was entirely different from the first visit in so many ways! We were seated further into the restaurant this time, up on a balcony, which was absolutely lovely as we were able to appreciate the bustle of the restaurant. Our waiter was so awesome and friendly, and was intent on making us feel welcomed.Escargot - Honestly will probably never come here and NOT order this. It was just as good as the first time - still sizzling when it came to our table and so flavorful. GET THIS!Cote de Bouf Pour Deux - BLOWN AWAY. Seriously, this was not only the most beautiful steak I've ever seen, but the most tender, phenomenal piece of meat I've ever eaten. We ordered medium rare and cutting through it was like slicing through butter. I cannot think of a different way to describe it. It's been a few weeks and I still think about it from time to time, to be honest. Came with a huge bone and two large pieces of bone marrow which was so creamy and indulgent. At a $155 price point, this dish probably isn't your average weekday order, but for an occasion, this is 100% worth!While I understand the attentiveness was a little more exaggerated than it would normally be, as the staff was probably aware that this visit was at the invitation of the manager, I would be  more than excited to come back again!!",6.608333333333333,0.24907212885154065
