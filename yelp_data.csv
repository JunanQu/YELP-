0,5.0 star rating,"My boyfriend and I had an amazing experience at Eleven Madison Park.  We had heard amazing things about the restaurant and had booked a trip to NYC with a sole purpose of dining at EMP, so we had fairly high expectations for the experience.  We were celebrating my birthday, and a few days prior to the reservation, the maitre d' reached out asking for dining preferences, general preferences (what do I like, need, etc.), and also offered to facilitate floral arrangements on my boyfriend's behalf.  When we walked in, we were promptly seated and were greeted by a handwritten birthday card that reflected my aesthetic preferences, and the magic began.  From the engraved bag hook to a private kitchen tour, the hospitality and attention to detail was nothing short of world class.  Food was amazing as expected as well - some of my favorites from the night include the dry aged duck (my boyfriend got the venison and was pleasantly surprised as well), the potato souffle with caviar, and the truffle pot dish.  I think we spent about three hours in the restaurant.  Sometimes for me, sitting three hours through food with long gaps in between gets tiring and a little boring (this was my experience at Per Se, where the ambiance is more strict / formal), but time truly flew by and I enjoyed every minute, thanks to their amazing staff and neighboring tables. It seems that their menu changes significantly every month or so, so I'll definitely come back in not too distant future.  Thanks again to team EMP for your hospitality!!"
1,5.0 star rating,"Ok where do I start I think if you reserved this restaurant, you know what to expect. I won't say it's the fanciest Michelin restaurant, but I wasn't disappointed. There's some hiccup while we were having our meal, the servers handled it very well; good attitude and good service recovery!Food wise, I won't comment much as most of the time I realized you really need a different taste palette to enjoy; also you need to be a little more educated to understand what kind of effort they have put in for each dish. If you don't understand good quality ice makes better cocktail, or if you don't know giving escargot special diet does mean something - then you probably won't appreciate this restaurant. I have seen people who only care glamorous complain about EMP, but first educate yourself so you know they have gone above and beyond. And they make ""above and beyond"" as their routine. Every single detail is being taken care of at the moment you walk into this restaurant; it's so subtle that you probably won't notice it."
2,4.0 star rating,Outstanding dining experience at Eleven Madison Park.
3,3.0 star rating,"The food other than the dessert was mostly great. The thing that angered me was they asked us to put our phones in a box so we do not look at our phones during the meal. We respected that and agreed. However, there are another table who was not asked and another table beside us that had special privileges who got a tour to the kitchen and were taking pictures with their phone during the meal. However, we weren't even allowed to have our phones with us and we believe we were being discriminated."
4,3.0 star rating,"Ok, if this was just another regular ole restaurant, the rating would have been 4 stars.  But this is not just a regular ole restaurant- this restaurant is rated as one of the top places in NYC, and in the world. Well I am dumbfounded! I do not exaggerate when I say I have been looking forward to coming here for months and I left feeling so completely disappointed. Not the feeling I thought I would have after this dining experience.The ambiance was nothing special. Its a large room with high ceilings and no style, plus it was freezing (ladies beware). The staff was excellent- no complaints there. But the food, le sigh, the food was truly underwhelming. First 2 courses were promising and consisted of caviar and oysters. But after that it was pretty basic and certainly not memorable. The lobster tail was ok, the duck was fine, the foie gras was satisfactory, the desert was eatable - but these aren't words I want to use when the check is over $1,000! I want my damn mind blown, but instead I was left wondering why everything was so, well, meh?I have been blessed to eat in some incredible restaurants like Per se, Blue Hill at Stone Farms, Le Bernardin, French Laundry, etc - But Eleven Madison didn't live up to the hype, reputation or price tag. No desire to ever return and super bummed."
5,3.0 star rating,"Disappointing. Can't believe this was #1 (and now #4) in the world!!! I just had #6 and #7 (Central and Maido) in the past 24 hours and I'm appalled that EMP ranks above them. Who are they paying to even make the Top 10?!?Don't get me wrong, service was on point and the venue is nice but the food was nothing amazing in terms of satisfaction. It was presented creatively (snail tacos were cool) and we liked the table-side prep of one of the dishes, but to us there was no consistent wow factor in terms of actual taste. Seems like it was all more for show than anything. If you're in NYC, your time -- and money--will be better spent at #12, Bluehill at Stonebarns."
6,5.0 star rating,Loved came with a hot escort and had champagne wine . Well worth the $1000 . Classy place . Unfortunately the girl cost more then dinner. Ill be back
7,2.0 star rating,"Was treated to a meal here by a friend and the 10 of us sat in a private room upstairs.  The menu seemed perfect, a mix of my favorites and everything I would want to hit up at a meal like this.  The service was very good as expected, though I would have expected more knowledge of ingredients for such an establishment.  Waiter was not sure the origin of the beef besides it being from Pat La Freda, the waitress was not sure of the name of the town in LI the salt came from, and not much info on the type of duck breast we were eating besides it being dry aged 14 days. Quick summary, 3 of the 9 dishes including amuse were inedible. Lets start with that amuse which was some sort of porcini cream in egg shell.  the first bite was so salt, I thought I just got a lump of salt, but the next bite confirmed it was all too salty and I tried it once more to make sure and could not finish.  Most people at table agreed.  Eggs Benedict course was a nice caviar dish reminiscent of the Jewish holidays, as it was basically caviar on top of whitefish salad that was probably made with cream cheese or butter.  Then came the Foie gras torchon which was nice, creamy, elegant, but should have been served with toast to cut the creaminess.  It was small, but tough to finish because it tasted like you were eating raw butter. next came butter poached lobster which was nice but poorly poached which left the lobster chewy.  The turnip, just yuck, not bad, gross.  Don't know what to say.  Many of the dishes actually had a very similar umami flavor, but just way too woodsy. Next was beef, was a roasted filet of unknown origin besides pat la freda.  covered in trumped mushrooms and served with a chestnut gravy.  My meat had a nice crust and perfectly cooked interior.  Was super duper tender and nice.  I tried a friends leftover and hers was leftover because it was all just red center without much crust because she had a center cut piece when mine had been an end cut.  Meat was good, but really expected something more special at EMP, maybe something with some age.  Next up was the duck which was the star of the night.  The szechuan pepper corns made my tongue tingle a little.  the skin was crispy and the meat was a perfect medium rare.  I finished 2 other people's duck as well. Next course of ""honeynut squash"" was actually a cheese course and was the third inedible dish of the night. the cracker was nice, but the squash cheddar mix was not for me, or most at the table.  Finished off with the Milk and Honey which like the duck was also amazing and what I expected of EMP.  On the way out, we were given the granola for breakfast in the AM but I finished most of mine in the uber home, its special. Overall very disappointed in the meal.  Can't believe there were 3 courses I literally could not finish based on the taste.  I'm an animal and have a really hard time not finishing everything in front of me! not here.  I think it was perhaps a result of not eating from main kitchen where they obviously keep their A team."
8,4.0 star rating,"I had lunch here in July, it was my third time visiting. I thought the staff and ambiance were excellent but the meal itself was underwhelming compared to the first two times I visited in 2015 and again in 2016. The duck was terrific but the other courses were less impressive. I really miss the originality of the carrot tartar course."
9,5.0 star rating,"I came here for a birthday dinner and everything was excellent! All of the food was great and the alcohol pairing was plentiful. I really liked that there was some choice in what you can get in comparison to a traditional tasting menu. My favorite dish from the night I went was the ""cheese course"" which was a soft pretzel with beer cheese and honeynut squash!"
10,2.0 star rating,"Me and my wife travel a lot and have been to many 2-3 star michelin in countries like France, Italy , Denmark and of course United States. There is always some amazing takeaways and memories Associated with every place of this magnitude. To say the lease we were extremely disappointed with food as well as the service of the staff. Place was just ok , not something we would expect especially when you are paying 1500 per couple and set your expectations high. Save yourself time and money and skip this place. Want 3 star michelin experience  in NY try chefs table instead ."
11,5.0 star rating,"Eleven Madison park has now become my favorite restaurant. My husband and I went to celebrate our anniversary. From the moment we stepped in, we felt warm and welcomed. The staff is extremely friendly and want to make sure you have a genuinely fantastic experience. Having been to other 3 michelin star restaurants including Le Bernardin (which was also amazing), what sets apart Eleven Madison park is the warm and friendly staff who make you feel like family. The food is exceptional. We went just in time for the fall menu and we devoured every single item in the almost 10 course meal. They really space apart the courses, so you never feel rushed to finish any meal. We really enjoyed speaking to several staff members especially the connoisseur Erica who was lovely and very informative. The staff also took us on a tour of the kitchen and we were given delicious, warm cider during the tour. Towards the end of our meal, they offered us brandy and choclate covered pretzels which were delicious. They also gave each of us a souvenir or breakfast granola in a jar along with a customized menu of everything we ordered for the meal.This was, by far, the best dining experience of my life and we will definitely come back to celebrate yet another milestone in our lives. Thank you to the exceptional staff of Eleven Madison Park."
12,5.0 star rating,"From our experience at my recent 21st wed anniversary experience, EMP is not a go-once bucket list.  Perfection and delight during our entire lunch experience.  Looking forward to a revisit.  Every dish was a surprise and delicious and wait staff was on top of every need.  Left full but not excessive.  See you soon."
13,5.0 star rating,"EMP had been on our radar for several years and we said the next time we came through NYC we should definitely book the reservation early.  And that's what we did!So... it's a little embarrassing.  We were late for our meal. We probably shouldn't have trusted google map estimated time and should have budgeted extra time and also had the slowest cabbie ever in the whole city.  but alas... this is what happens when you aren't from New York.  on the way over, we made sure to call to let them know and they were extremely nice about the whole thing.  When we arrived we apologized and they didn't even bat an eye.  And told us that it's great that we made it! Onto the meal!  The food was spectacular.  Equal parts art and delicious.  The caviar was definitely out of this world.  The flavors all came together beautifully like the harmonies in a symphony.  The foie gras was also heavenly- the flavors all enveloped the senses and man I just couldn't get enough.  The crab cake underneath the bed of squash - wow they take so much care to make sure each piece is cooked perfectly and exactly the same size.The 140 days dry aged ribeye was also ridiculousness.  Perfectly cooked and perfectly melts in your mouth. The meal at EMP was definitely one to remember.  Every single dish was amazing, the service was fantastic."
14,5.0 star rating,"Eleven Madison Park was on my friend's bucket list of restaurants to dine at. So we made it happen. It topped the list of the best 50 restaurants in the world in 2017 https://www.theworlds50best.com/The-List-2017/1-10/Eleven-Madison-Park.html, 2018 https://www.theworlds50best.com/The-List-2018/1-10/Eleven-Madison-Park.html, and it has 3 Michelin Stars. It's currently considered the best restaurant in North America in 2018 and ranked 4th in the world. Dining in the main dining area lunch or dinner will run you about $315 per person before tax. Hot tip: they offer a 5-course bar tasting for $175 per person plus tax. Gratuity is already included in the price so that's all you should expect to pay. Reservations are strongly recommended. They require payment when booking with very little likelihood of refunds (check the refund policy on the website). We went with the bar tasting during the lunch hour on a Friday. When we arrived, they knew exactly who we were, which is impressive and unnerving at the same time. They took our coats when we checked in, we made a quick stop at the ladies room to wash our hands, and then we were shown the way to our table. We ordered some drinks to begin and while they had some great offerings on the cocktail menu, I asked for a Gold Rush. Eleven Madison Park is located at 11 Madison Avenue, easily assessable via public transportation. The restaurant itself is beautiful with high ceilings and gorgeous windows. The servers were great. The food was next level in gastronomy. We were given choices in our 5-course bar menu. We were also given a printed menu at the end of our meal. One of my friend's was celebrating her birthday as well and they wished her a happy birthday on the menu. I had the following:Black and white - this was the amuse bouche which was a savory cookie with cheddar and apple. Caviar - served in a tin with egg omelette, corn, and ham served with housemade mini English muffins. This was decadent, rich, and lovely. I'd never had caviar in this way but it was surprisingly good. I ate the entire thing. We really loved the English muffins too and could have just feasted on those. Foie gras - this was served with eggplant and mint in bar shape, decorated with edible flowers. This was so pretty but I put it in my mouth anyway. The flavors were sublime. The texture was to be expected from foie gras. My friend who didn't like foie in this way opted for the melon course. Lobster - we all had this lobster course with greens and bean ecrasse. They poured this liquid over it and it was delicious. The lobster was delicate and not fishy at all. I wasn't sure I would enjoy it but I did. Duck - I was the only one to order the duck with honey and lavender glaze served with blueberries and onion on the side. There were more edible flowers. It was a gorgeous dish. My friends opted for the dry aged beef. I loved the duck because skin was encrusted with all these herbs. The flavors were amazing on the tongue. The blueberries and onion was an odd side but it worked. Side note: my friend found a hair on her dish and they took it back immediately offering her profuse apologies and another entrée. She refused because she was full, so we all ended up getting an extra course which consisted of the Triple Crème (cherry jam and basil crème fraiche). The Triple Crème was served with their housemade brioche and it was really amazing. We asked for more bread. Is that bad? For dessert we were given the choice of the Chocolate or the Blackberry. I went with Chocolate - sorbet with shortbread crust and a coffee meringue. The Blackberry dish was berry ice cream and granita with caramelized milk and lemon. Dessert was gorgeously plated and was sublime. Lastly, we were given chocolate pretzels and an ounce of Eleven Madison Park's very own Apple Brandy. The apple brandy was very strong. The chocolate pretzels were a tasty end to an otherwise amazing meal. But they weren't done, when they presented the printed menu, they gave us each a jar of housemade granola https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014304-eleven-madison-park-granola to take home. Dining here was definitely a checkmark off the bucket list. Despite the snafu, they responded with grace and generosity. We had an extraordinary and memorable experience. If you're celebrating something special, this is a place I would definitely recommend."
15,3.0 star rating,"Overrated! Every dish is over salted, and they really need to learn plating, some dishes were unable to look at. There's too much small mistakes and it's definitely not a Michelin Three Star restaurant standard"
16,2.0 star rating,"I've been holding off on writing this review as I reflected on my experience at EMP. Once ranked the #1 restaurant in the world and currently ranked the #4 in the world - I really did expect more.Food - 3.5/5: Many of the dishes were very good and some were misses. Overall the food did reflect New York clearly, but emphasized technique over flavor and innovation.Service - 1/5: The service really was some of the worse I have received at a fine dining establishment. The waiters were not very friendly and quite condescending when we asked any questions that were outside ""what is in the dish"".Lowlight: When we asked about splitting a wine pairing - they unkindly made us feel silly for even asking. There are betters ways to approach this such as offering some potentially well paired bottles or glasses. This made some of my dining companions so uncomfortable that they didn't even want to drink from the wines I had ordered, feeling that they would be ""judged"" by the waitstaff.While the food is decent, the atmosphere and particularly the service leaves a lot to be desired. In comparison to similar ranked restaurants such as Mugaritz, Azurmendi, Pujol, Quintonil, to name a few - the service here is not only bad, but completely detracted from the experience."
17,5.0 star rating,"This place is a dream! One of the best restaurant I had been. The place is absolutely beautiful, the lamps on the ceiling, the flowers. The food was absolutely delicious."
18,4.0 star rating,"Quite a belated review, as I dined here in March for our anniversary and it's nearly October, but I needed to sit on this experience to fully digest (pun intended) everything that occurred during the meal before formulating my opinion. My final conclusion is that the meal was fine, even great, but the experience as a whole simply did not live up to the hype. I recommend coming here during the lunch service for best photo opportunities, because if you're paying 1k+ for a meal, you best be taking as many pictures as possible. For all the talk about fantastic service here, we had quite a prolonged and awkward experience. It started with a misunderstand between the choices offered which subsequently led to extremely stilted exchanges with our server throughout the rest of our four hour meal. Then there was also a spot of sauce that the server (a separate one) accidentally rubbed across and firmly into our tablecloth. And then the whole truffle that was dropped onto the ground mid-preparation. And then comes the philosophical question of whether ANYONE really needs to sit through a four hour marathon of a meal. The courses were, of course, beautiful and expertly crafted but towards the tail end of the meal everything became a chore. Frankly, I haven't had another tasting menu experience in the 6 months since our visit because I had been totally turned off all aspects of fine dining. That is not to say this wasn't a great experience -- because it is, it is worth the money and time to experience what is hands down one of the greatest restaurants and culinary feast in the world. The food were literal works of art, the flavors divine. But as a whole package...the experience just fell flat, likely because of how hyped up everything has become. Not much else to add, except that the champagne was extremely yummy :)"
19,2.0 star rating,We have been there twice and its not a memorable experience. The food is not tasty nor is it unique.  I would look for other Michelin 2 and 3* in Manhattan for an Anniversary / Birthday.
20,5.0 star rating,"The mixologist is on point, the staff is extremely tentative. I was there Easter weekend  and we got our dessert brought out in an Easter basket. Of course I got the cook book with the chef signature. I need to come back post restaurant renovation- it's been a year now"
21,4.0 star rating,"Good meal. I enjoyed some of the dishes but, others I was not as impressed with. We also asked to see the kitchen afterwards. They said we needed to tell them that prior to eating. But, eventually let us see it. Thought this was strange because, I saw two other groups go in and there were only two of us."
22,4.0 star rating,"Looking at the past couple of year's photos/menu, I could understand why they were the 'world's best restaurant' and perhaps why they're not anymore. These pictures showed showed more exquisite dishes. I expected caviar, lobster, heavenly seafood/meats to be thrown at me but its a lot more of bread, more bread, and then fruits/veggies and a little bit of the luxury dishes. I think some of food were a little too basic and some that I eat casually on a regular night out maybe not caviar though. I understand preparation and skills are completely different though. This is shown more in detail if you visit the kitchen (it's insanely clean and organized). If you're not bothered by the ~$350 price tag per person and want a memorable experience then I would recommend it. I don't think the food was entirely worth it, but the overall experience, sure. My family were happy with many of the dishes and found the price tag worthy (not that easy for my Asian parents to be impressed btw). Service was impeccable and friendly as expected. I do think the dinner was a little too long (~3 hours) but I ended up being full despite the small portions. We were even able to tour the kitchen for a little bit, which was one of the best part (I'd recommend that you ask prior to your reservation!) Plus you'll get a little treat! We had a raspberry with lemon ""lollipop."" Since I celebrated my birthday here I even got a beautiful chocolate bar along with their usual parting gifts (granola and a list of dishes you had in a tin). Onto some of the food.. Black and white cookie- 3/5 This was a cookie made with cheddar and apple. I'm not crazy about cookies so this was just okay to me, kinda tasted like a classier ritz cracker with cheese. This was left on the table and everyone gets one piece. Tomato Tea- 4/5 I've had tomato soup and other soupy like things with tomato but never a tomato TEA. This looked exactly like tea and not its vibrant red color. It's quite light yet it almost wants to be like a tomato soup (slightly thick/heavier) but its not quite there. This was probably one of the most unique thing I've tasted. They had a summer herb bundle, which made the tea beautiful and appealing. Dosa- 5/5 I really enjoyed this with the goat cheese and green tomatoes. I think it really suited the dosa well. The dosa itself was crispy and had basil (?) on one end of it and a great starter. Tomato Salad with Summer Berries-4/5 I'm very picky with tomatoes, I will mostly eat tomatoes on the vine or tomatoes from farmer markets, and that's about it. These tomatoes were lovely and delicious along with the sweet and juicy berries. A refreshing, enjoyable, and light dish to go along with the other tomato themed dishes. Corn soufflé- 4.5/5 This is what I was expecting-caviar. This dish was pretty delicious, the caviar was slightly salty but the corn soufflé and crème fraîche balances it out nicely. Crab- 4.5/5 This was one of the most beautiful and tastiest dishes. It was a crab salad with zucchini and lemon. Thinly sliced zucchini (thank God, because I'm not a really big fan of zucchini and this was actually bearable) and beneath it was this jello like film which was really tasty with the crab. I really loved the presentation of this as well- so pretty~!Lobster-3/5 I was honestly a little disappointed with this dish because the server gave unequal amounts of sauce with it and I felt like the lobster was a little undercooked and chewy. I had to swallow a whole piece because it wasn't cutting up properly. This was wrapped in some kind of herb or vegetable and it was getting kinda repetitive. I think it could have been done without the extra wrapping and just butter-poached lobster with some veggies on the side or something. Chanterelles-4.5/5 Any sort of fire being brought to the table excites me (I'm not a pyromania or anything like that) but when they brought a mini grill for the 5 of us I thought it was pretty cool. The grilled chanterelles were pretty delicious along with the onions. They give you a veggie wrap along with several condiments (not really sure exactly what they were), but when I mixed it altogether, it tasted really great! Halibut-3/5 This was a bit of a letdown because I thought it was a bit too basic and tasted similar to something my dad makes. The halibut was served with lemon verbena and ginger, but the sauce tasted slightly like honey and was on the sweeter side. Peach-4.5/5 I love peaches- they're just so sweet and juicy. This dish wasn't overly sweet and there was honey custard and compote to balance everything out. Chocolate Covered Pretzel- 3/5 This was way too much. I think it would have ended better on the previous dessert. This was overly sweet and made me think of stealing my grandma's insulin shot (I didn't though). My mother and father couldn't even finish it and I had to force it down."
23,4.0 star rating,Checked into this high end restaurant in SOHO area in NY. This is an expensive 8 course restaurant. You need 3 hours for the experience. You will need to make reservation many weeks ahead of time. I have to say the whole experience was fantastic. Great service with many servers per section of the restaurant. Each disk was very good.
24,4.0 star rating,"My friend and I had dinner at Eleven Madison Park one night while in NYC. I was super hyped as when I went in May it stood as the number 1 restaurant in the world in rankings! It's since slid down to #4 in the world but still #1 in the US.Now was it the best Michelin star experience I've had? Honestly, I'd give that to Alinea (which is now down to #34 in the world, #5 in the country), but according to the experts, this is the BEST. It's truly interesting to me how various restaurants get scored. It was indeed a solid and interesting meal with beyond excellent service.I suggest watching the documentary on Eleven Madison Park before going so you can truly build an appreciation all that goes into this restaurant. The Restaurateur on Netflix, do it.The entire meal was solid and some dishes were very good! I can't say a single dish blew me completely away though. However highlights of the meal for me were Snails with morels & ramps, the Goat Cheese variations and the Chocolate pretzels at the end of the meal. Plus they gave us granola to go in an adorable glass container. So nice and considerate to have a little parting gift for us! They also gave my friend a chocolate bar for his birthday, love the little touches.I'm incredibly glad I experienced this restaurant but for me personally, it's a one and done type of experience. For $315, I'd rather do Alinea again and again."
25,5.0 star rating,"More than anticipated. Very comfortable atmosphere and the food was more than impressive. The first course of ""tomato tea"" and the cheese course are by far one of the most impressive, delicious and imaginative culinary experiences. I appreciate how hard every person at Eleven Madison Park works to create an experience any customer would enjoy."
26,3.0 star rating,"Reading some of these detailed reviews, I would agree the food is very good. However for the price, my expectation is that it should stand out, and provide a memorable and unique experience.  After eating here, I can say that everything was fine, but nothing was exceptional or creative, except for the Tomato Tea.  In this category, you are paying for something that should be as good as per se, Joel robuchon, Lebernadin, Daniel, Alain Ducase, etc..  I've been to all of these places and every one of them had something you would remember a year later.  I realize it is not a ""French"" restaurant, but for this price, that list of places are the comparables, and if you disagree then what do we compare this to?  Here, the food presentation was lacking. The flavors are great, but not distinguishing at this level. The service was just OK, but impersonal and functional to the point where a robot would have been more appreciated, and memorable (unlike the food). Dine here, and comment on it, but help others by giving  your relative impression of other $300 restaurants rather than just describing their menu in isolation. If you are going to spend that kind of money, spend it on the best $300 restaurant."
27,1.0 star rating,"The price they asking is just outrageous considering the food offered. I wish I could say I enjoyed it. After all, we booked months ahead and spent over a grand for the dinner. But I can't even said it was good tasting, not to mention outstanding. The service is very attentive, too attentive that it somehow making me felt a bit...uncomfortable? This place is just overrated and overpriced."
28,2.0 star rating,"VERY BAD SERVICE. I went to EMP two years ago but when today my friends asked me about the experience, they all insisted me to write it down. So what happened was that the waiter dropped a glass of wine on my boyfriend's trousers and the wine also spilled onto his white shoes. There was no apology from the waiter. He didn't say any word. Seems like he didn't feel sorry at all. All he did was clean up the spill on the floor, picked up all the broken glass pieces, and went away. He then came back with a new glass of wine, but still didn't say anything. I'm pretty sure he can speak because he speaks a lot when introducing us about the dishes. We were stupid that we gave him normal tips. Four stars for the food, my boyfriend enjoyed the ""picnic scene"" course but the caviar that day was below the level. Negative stars for the service. Very arrogant waiter. Two stars in total."
29,5.0 star rating,"Dining at Eleven Madison Park was truly worth it! With a six hour time difference, making a reservation was a challenge, but it's such a pleasure and an amazing experience though, with some of the friendliest and efficient staff around. No wonder, you guys are still number one in the country. Food was just marvelous! With a penchant for cheese, I was simply blown away and excited for any dish that had them. Even for hubby who was not a cheese person, he was very impressed too! The superb use of ingredients was just exemplary! The portions too were just perfect that every course/dish was simply enjoyable! Special kudos to Jenny Escalante, whose expertise and excellence was admirable! Would love to go back!"
30,1.0 star rating,"**first time reviewer, i only created an account on yelp because of this restaurant. nothing has ever driven me to post before.**This restaurant's re-entrance to the scene (post reno) is negligible. This meal was ok.... at best. But for the price tag, I was hoping for much more than ""ok"". Sure, the service was decent (they wished my husband ""happy birthday"" every time he breathed so I couldn't call it inattentive) but compared to the service at my husband's birthday dinner last year at Per Se (during which, the staff made us feel like royalty) this was forced and bordering on uncomfortable. The dishes themselves were lackluster. Honestly, I can't remember anything I ate (please note I didn't drink that night because I'm breastfeeding and I keep a very detailed food journal to remember my favorite meals... so for me to not remember something? Not cool for a restaurant of this caliber.) Best thing I ate was the granola they sent us home with for breakfast. I've dined at most of the world's top 10 restaurants (here is my metric: https://m.theworlds50best.com/index.html) and this is the only one I would absolutely not return to. If you're looking for a wonderful fine dining experience in NYC I'd suggest Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare, Per Se or Gabriel Kreuthers."
31,5.0 star rating,Came here for my birthday last year around March and it exceeded my expectations. I've heard rave reviews about this spot. It's pretty hard to get into so you should expect to make reservations at least a month in advance. I've since heard that they redid the whole place so I am really looking forward to paying them another visit soon! Did I mention it made it on the list of the world's TOP TEN 5 star Michelin restaurants. It's worth all the hype. Each course is more unique and beautifully presented than the next. Plan ahead and make your reservation months in advance! Enjoy!
32,5.0 star rating,"I wish I could give 6 stars!!!  We had an intimate wedding celebration in a private room. The private dining coordinator, Cecilia made the process easy and seamless. The meal was beyond our expectations. We started with a 1/2 hour of champagne and pass around bites. It's hard to say which bite was packed with more flavor. The white fish with caviar, the carrot tartare with horseradish, the scallops on the half shell or the fois gras with strawberries. The bites were small but so flavorful and balanced. The best part was seeing everyone's faces with each bite. The entrees, dessert, wedding cake, and wine selections were also truly amazing. When we asked our guests, what was the tastiest dish, the answer was unanimous. EVERYTHING!  The poached lobster and tornados of beef were amazing choices. I need to mention the excellent service. From start to finish the staff was warm, friendly, welcoming and gracious attending to our guests individual needs. By the time we left I felt I had one of the best dining experiences ever. This was an expensive meal but well worth it. Thanks Eleven Madison Park."
33,4.0 star rating,"Being a former ranked ""best restaurant in the world"", the expectations were huge. As we went in we noticed a few things such as the opulently high ceilings and the elegant interior design. Everything pointed out to be a glorious night of pleasure and umami. Every dish was perfectly executed, but sadly nothing blew me away. Not the flavors in order to live up to such high honors, nor the chef's creativity and pairing of ingredients and the service lacked true carrying. Our server seemed to just go through the motions and Couldn't answer a couple of questions I threw at him which he should've been trained to answer at a venue like this.One thing that was quite weird in my opinion is how the server gives you the verbal option of picking different dishes. The options were not even written and felt peer pressured to make a quick decision.It seems that food critics place a huge premium on table side service as I though this restaurant doesn't deserve to be idolized the way it does...Best part of the meal was the take home granola and the printed menu placed in a quirky little box."
34,5.0 star rating,From beginning to end this place makes you feel both exclusive and comfortable (which is hard to do). The service was top notch and the food we amazing. We have gone to some of the best restaurants in the US and this one is in our top 5 for sure.
35,5.0 star rating,"A restaurant and meal as elaborate as this deserves only an elaborate review, so through this I will list every single bite I ate, describing each course in immense detailThe staff at this restaurant were hospitable, and entertaining to watch. They would describe each course in detail before handing it out. They also know when to leave you be or when to check in. Clearing the table seemed to be a choreographed action, it was ridiculous."
36,2.0 star rating,"Honestly.......not great. I have eaten at many highly rated restaurants around the word. Tonight's experience was disappointing. I really really wanted to like it. Service was good, but not great. The wine glasses are covered in white ""fuzz"". Seriously, check for yourself!!! When I brought this to their attention I was told ""ohhh, it's just the towels we used to clean them with....they are super clean !!"" REALLY???!!! I love ""super clean"" glasses with cleaning cloth fuzz all over them!!! The crab entree tasted like crab placed in a vita mix, doused in cucumber, also, produced from a vita mix.  Generally slimy.... honestly. I ate one bite. When my plate was cleared no one was like ""hey.... did you not like this??"" ....which is par for the service expected at a high end, ""spectacular"" restaurant. Instead, it was simply cleared away and the next course was delivered. I could go on and on, but it's more of the same story. Not great. Disappointing. Not recommended."
37,3.0 star rating,Well... I really wanted to go here for the longest.  Especially since it was the #1.  It now has been a few weeks since I've dined there.  I don't remember much of what I ate.  Nothing really stood out.  If they just gave me a jar of caviar... maybe I'll remember that.  Things were nicely cooked.  Wines were expensive and good.  Service was great.  Decor was nothing special; expected more and was a bit underwhelmed.  That's all... not much more to say about this over-hyped restaurant.
38,5.0 star rating,"A real experience. Amazing service, the food was fantastic and it is real artistry and pursuit of perfection. Hard to put a $ value on it but we pay $500+ pp for certain Broadway tix so everything can be justified. We did the paired wines and truly experienced some vino that was fantastic, paired beautifully with the food and was different than what we would normally order."
39,5.0 star rating,"This is an elegant restaurant. I'm not sure what it looked like before their renovation last summer, but currently the place is very quaint with it's large windows along the side, and otherwise minimalist decor.  I came here in late winter, so it got dark early, but I imagine during the summer months, the dining hall overall would be very well lit for most of the dinner service.Overall the food here was fantastic. Each dish I had was going to highlight a specific flavor / texture of what was served.  For the dishes, there were no specific guidelines as to how we should best consume the food, we were just served and let be. For the tasting menu here, there are a couple of times where we were given an option to choose what we would like to have. My favorite dish of the evening was the Dry-Aged Duck, and is still the best duck I've had to date. After the entrees, and as part of dessert, we were given this bottle of Apple Brandy. If i recall, i was free to drink as much as i wanted, but be warned, it's quite strong.Unfortunately did not get the wine pairing, but there is a full bar, where you can order something off their menu or go for the option where you tell your server what alcohols / flavors you like and the bartender will try to create something that suits your tastes. After dinner, you get the option to tour the kitchen, and on the way out as you collect your bags / coat, you're given a container of their house made granola as well as a menu documenting your dishes of the evening."
40,4.0 star rating,"The service and the presentation of the dishes were outstanding. Pairing wine perfect! There were stunning courses (see pictures captions), but unfortunately some other ones I didn't like.The foie gras terrine was only beautiful to look at, lobster was just ok, the duck was a huge disappointment, overpowered by the flavor of the seasoning, chocolate desert could have been missed. All the rest was great. Unfortunately for what you pay everything should have been just flawless.It was a good experience and I had a good lunch, but I wouldn't go back again."
41,5.0 star rating,This is just one of those places you have to experience first hand. If I explain too much you take away from the wonderful journey they take you  using your 5 senses. Will be returning when the opportunity presents itself.
42,5.0 star rating,"Elegant gourmet restaurant that provides guests a unique and intimate dining experience.--THE FOOD: I mean, it's a three star Michelin restaurant, so yes the food is amazing. But the dishes are so much more than flavorful -- they are a treat for all the senses. Each course was completely distinct in its own way while subtly building off the flavors of previous dishes to provide a fully satisfying culinary experience.--FOR THE VEGGIES: My fiancé, after some pretty extensive research, selected this restaurant precisely because they were said to have one of the best vegetarian tasting menus, and we were not disappointed. --THE SERVICE: Our visit to Eleven Madison was in honor of a special occasion -- my fiancé had just proposed to me a few hours before -- and Eleven Madison made the day even more memorable with fabulous service. We were welcomed with complimentary champagne served in Tiffany glasses that they later gave to us as an engagement gift (with the signature box, ribbon, and bag of course). They also graciously gave us a second momento--a hand drawn guide to the herbal blooms featured in our meal, since my fiancé had shown such interest in them. We left so thoroughly impressed by the intimate, courteous service and the personalized, unique gifts.--THE ATMOSPHERE: We dined at Eleven Madison during the day when it was full of natural light that accentuated the elegant minimalist decor. Although the dining room was full, it maintained a peaceful, quiet feel."
43,2.0 star rating,"Sigh.  I came here again after a few years and the renovations.  We came in the winter so this review is overdue.  That day their heating wasn't working so they called to tell us to dress comfortably (I don't pay over $1000 for a dinner for 2 to wear sweats..).  We arrive and there are tiny space heaters by our feet that did nothing.  We were freezing the whole time and had to keep our coats on.  Now, I understand this stuff happens, but you would think they would at least offer you a complimentary glass of sparking or something.  Nope nothing, didn't even apologize or mention it again.Onto the food, perhaps again it was the heating issue, but all of the food was cold!  My duck was one of the worst ducks I've had in a long time, strangely prepared and COLD.  Literally cold when served (it was not meant to be cold..).  The rest of the food was immemorable. This was my third time at EMP and we were truly disappointed."
44,5.0 star rating,"Flew to New York as a surprise anniversary gift from my husband. I've been wanting to go to this restaurant since our last trip with family and friends two years ago but it's very tough to get reservations for a big group at this restaurant. Specially during the holidays. Less than a week before our flight we made reservations at various restaurants that came highly recommended. Then the day before our flight, I glanced upon a book while I was rearranging our credenza in the dining room. It's the Eleven Madison Park book that I've kept in our dining room! I thought we might as well try to make the reservation and hope for the best! They had no available seating so we chose the option the join the waitlist because it says sold out on the dates we chose. Then the next morning, aboard the plane right before our flight we got a call about a cancellation and we were told that there's an availability! I was so happy! This was meant to be! The restaurant is beautiful specially the huge windows where you can see the trees at Madison Park! I enjoyed every dish that was served! The ingredients were very fresh and just delicious! The dishes that stood out is the Camembert cheese with creme fraiche and basil/parsley pesto, escargot with mushroom that was served on a tabletop grill and then you remove it with tweezers and wrap it in lettuce & chard leaf and the cookie that was given first that's in a box  before the start of the meal. The duck and the steak was good but nothing memorable or exceptional. I also absolutely love the dish with caviar. It was deliciously prepared! After our meal we got to tour their kitchen! It was surprising to see 40 plus people in there! Everyone were very focused on each dish they are making. It looks very artistic, creative and so beautiful! They change menus every season! I'm looking forward to trying their winter menu next time! Hopefully on our next lunch/dinner here we get to catch a glimpse  of the genius Mr. Humm!"
45,1.0 star rating,"I have been left with no choice but to leave a one star review. I honestly expect better from such a well established place. It has fallen short in my eye due to lack of professionalism/edict. I understand the how the reservation system works, I also understand how the wait list works. But to not have the decency to contact your guests weather on wait list or not, to inform them prior to their reservation that they unfortunately would not be able to accommodate you, is tacky and tasteless. We all know that you and your reservation staff are very well informed ahead of time and could easily inform the guests who have been waiting patiently, that they unfortunately will not be accommodating them tastefully. Instead you choose to leave them hanging out to dry like as if they do not matter to you in the slightest. It is extremely gross in nature and this is the place that was chosen to receive such high ratings? But yet they lack in reservation edict/professionalism! I truly hope that your management team reads and learns from this. You do not deserve your stars without being well rounded from front to back and top to bottom. Revise your edict and pick up your slack, because it makes you look extremely tacky and tasteless. Very sad day to be honest."
46,5.0 star rating,"One on my best dining experiences this year at emp. Waited only a few minutes to be seated. Beautiful place, excellent ambiance and exquisite service. Started with some champagne. First course was great looking, however not my favorite. My actually favorite were the sturgeon cheesecake with caviar, it tasted just like a lox which is funny because I had one that same day as breakfast at russ & daughters, the duck and I also tried my friend's lamb. One of the desserts was black and gray, but tasted just like key lime pie, delicious. Basically almost everything was great. I was feeling so special when we were invited to the kitchen and offered an hors d'oeuvre made by obe of the chefs until we realized most people get the same experience LOL...stil cool. Excellent experience, that's why it was the number 1 in the world. All in all it is a 4.5 stars."
47,4.0 star rating,"The service is amazing. The food is a new experience and bar tasting menu has absolutely enough food if you are not hungry for three days.I have never tasted things like this before. They made different flavors really stand out while keeping them harmonious with each other. Unlike having barbeque or hot pot, dining here feels almost like wandering in a perfume store. You will enjoy the general feeling of the product, but you can't really distinguish the actual food's taste.The only exception is perhaps the main dish. We had ribeyes and duck breast. They both emphasized tenderness and flavor. But they also mixed in their own novelty.To be honest, I would rather feel the original flavor of the ingredients. But it's worth trying if you havent' been here before."
48,5.0 star rating,The most unbelievable experience I've ever had thus far. Made the reservation a month in advance. Being #4 best restaurant in the world is a big deal and I was so happy to be able to experience this restaurant. From the amazing food to the Somm to the impeccable service to Claire that was super accommodating  to make this dinner experience a great one. We had the best table in house ( or at least it sure was to us ) to all the flavors. A must try experience. The goodie bag at the end is a great touch as well.
49,4.0 star rating,"My dad saw that this restaurant was considered ""the best in the world"" so we had to come see for ourselves. It was rather difficult to get a reservation at a decent time (i.e. not at 10pm, which seemed to be the only choice for weeks), but I regularly checked the website and eventually found a reservation at 7:15pm for a Thursday night. There was hardly any signage out front, so finding the restaurant wasn't as easy as it should have been. I was greeted immediately after going through the revolving doors, and I took a seat near the host station and was given a glass of water while I waited for the rest of my party to arrive.We were seated near the front of the restaurant. The table was large enough and the chairs were so comfortable. The service here was impeccable, as expected. Our waters were constantly refilled, crumbs brushed away, and utensils replaced throughout the evening. There were a lot of courses, so I can't really remember exactly what we ate but I'll highlight some of the ones that stood out to me. The corn was amazing. The duck, one of the main courses I believe, was so delicious. My brother raved about the caviar, and my dad loved the steak. The lobster was a little chewier than I would have preferred, but still really good. The snails were fun to eat. They brought out a mini grill so we could finish grilling the snails ourselves. It included 4 sauces that you can add, and then they give you some lettuce to wrap the snails around. Dessert was good too. I wish I could say this was the best dining experience I've ever had, but it wasn't. I'm not really sure what it was; maybe my expectations were too high. Everything was just fine, but it was literally just that: fine. It didn't wow me like some other restaurants have, and the food was delicious and presented very creatively, but I don't think I would come back here because I don't think it's worth the price tag."
50,4.0 star rating,"We went for a corporate event. I have lots of pictures but my husband's placecard with his name is in full display , and he prefers I not post it. Incredible venue, service was not to be believed, but the food was fine. Not one dish blew my socks off. Yes, it is definitely art on a plate but I'd rather have more than one bite of each course. What if I did love it? I really wanted to. I think maybe my palate just isn't what it should be as I found everything salty and I love salt. One thing I did appreciate is that some bar patrons were getting rowdy and they squashed that nonsense immediately. Too many high end places won't do that because of the high price tag to get in. I think that was my favorite part. Yes, we did go to Shake Shack after. This girl was in NYC and she was still hungry!"
51,3.0 star rating,"Service was great but the food was too salty. My husband and I were surprised of the salty dish all around, given the reputable 3 Michelin Star restaurantDessert was the best course for us"
52,4.0 star rating,"I've had one good and one bad experience, averaging four stars.  Our first experience was beyond world-class.  Flawless in every way.  Our next experience was an opposite one, so I'll talk about that.First, our captain was a ghost.  Had she engaged the table more than a brief visit, she would have noticed that the kitchen was dragging.  The sommelier, who IS world-class, should have also noticed that she was pouring our pairings thirty minutes before our courses arrived to a dry glass.  She also failed to spend more than 30 seconds per pour, leaving us with the name of each wine and vintage, with no pairing notes or other useful information.Unfortunately, I waited toward the end of the courses to voice my frustration.  The manager approached and informed me that the menu was transitioning, which is fine, but not in a live dining room at this level.  He offered nothing more than an apology for a blown evening.  A future reservation guarantee would have been an appropriate gesture.  He also could have ensured that his floor was staffed in a way that allowed our potentially amazing sommelier to exercise her amazingness as she was clearly stretched.I'm profoundly disappointed and would like to give it another shot, but I honestly don't consider EMP even close to the best in the world or even the best in the country.  Our first experience definitely held to that standard, but consistency is imperative as guests are usually going to remember their worst experience, which is also likely to be their last."
53,5.0 star rating,"As a former best restaurant in the world winner, expectations were running high. EMP has been on my list of places to visit for almost a decade. It was on my radar before it rose from a two to three star Michelin restaurant, but now it's kind of a big deal in the restaurant world. I decided to take my fiancee for our three year anniversary, but I've also been hearing mixed reviews on their most recent tasting menu and decided to opt for the abbreviated bar tasting menu instead on our most recent visit to NYC - that would later be a regretful decision.We arrived a couple minutes early for our reservation, but were quickly seated at a large private table near the bar. The bar seating is tucked away in the back and a much darker area compared to the brightly lit main dining hall. Our first course was already awaiting to be opened in front of us with a box that held two black and white cookies (if you don't know what these are, they're synonymous with NYC and everywhere in the city). Except, the twist was that the black and white cookie was a cheese cookie with cheddar and apple filling. Our next course was my favorite of the evening: the caviar Benedict with corn and smoked sturgeon. It literally tasted like an amazing deconstructed Benedict, served in a caviar tin with bread. It was beautifully presented, but even more important, so flavorful with every scoop and bite. The menu started diverging with choices of a few courses. We tried both the foie gras and the crab next. The foie gras was marinated with eggplant and mint and was very rich in flavor. In contrast, the crab dish was presented with a salad of zucchini and lemon and was elegantly plated like everything else, but the flavor was very light and refreshing.The fourth course was the lobster, grilled with greens and bean ecrasse. Having recently traveled from New England, we had eaten three lobster rolls in two days and were pretty lobstered out. But this lobster was simply cooked to perfection and arguably better than the fresh lobster rolls we were eating in Maine, which was mind-blowing to me. There were only three small morsels, but each was packed with flavor.The main courses consisted of a dry aged beef and grilled with peppers and an aged duck, honey and lavender glazed with blueberries and onion. Of the two, the beef was the winner and my second favorite dish of the meal. By itself, the beef was good, but eaten with the peppers took it to another level. Something as simple as this was made so well was quite impressive. The duck was a little on the tough side for my liking, but the flavors were great nonetheless.For dessert, we chose a cheese course with a triple creme in brioche with cherry and basil creme fraiche, which again had so many flavors between the sweet cherry and the creamy cheese within the brioche. For the other, we chose the blackberry ice cream and granita with caramelized milk and lemon. The presentation was very minimalist, but it was quite tasty. Dinner ended with a delicious chocolate covered peanut butter pretzel served with brandy.As a bonus, I requested to tour the kitchen as I wouldn't know the next time I would be back. It's definitely not guaranteed as they had to work a few things out, but we were treated to a short viewing to the new, renovated kitchen. The kitchen didn't look like a typical restaurant kitchen, instead reminiscent of an immaculate lab with so many moving pieces working in perfect synchrony. As a parting gift, we were given a very nice glass jar of granola to have for breakfast the next day (which was amazing as well).The bar tasting dinner lasted around 2.5 hours so I can't imagine how long the typical tasting would take. Booking is through Tock months in advance and cost $175, gratuity and tax included, which is quite a good price given a 3 star Michelin and consistently in the top 5 Best Restaurants in the World rankings. I would definitely return to try the full tasting menu next time and highly recommend coming here."
54,5.0 star rating,"This was an amazing experience in food and art! No wonder it is a Michelin favorite! My husband and his friends were here a few years ago (without me...boo) and have not stopped talking about it. I used my birthday wish this year to finally savor the splendor they keep reminiscing about. And now, I can't stop talking about it either!From ambiance with the high ceilings and comfortable dining, to the choreographed service and the delicious food--the evening was a masterpiece! So glad we arrived early to enjoy the daylight shining thru from the park that subtly came to a romantic end. It's like sitting in your own art gallery, everywhere you look is a feast for the eyes--on the walls, on the floor, and on your plate! When you arrive, the revolving doors put you in this bright airy space. Ascend the steps to an elevated dining area surrounded by a gorgeous metal piece that reminds me of cornstalks. Hanging high on the far wall is a beautiful blue artwork (Rita Ackermann), on the upper right wall are darkened mirrors/windows that dances with the sunset. The seating was comfortable and inviting despite the vastness of the room. Every course presented was an art piece. The flavors burst in my mouth like a little celebration with each bite. It was inventive, light and left me craving more. The flavors did not overpower one another. The wine and cocktails paired beautifully. It was a beautiful symphony. The staff were personable and attentive. Chef Humm came out to greet the diners and sheepishly came to our table as one of my friends excitedly gestured him our way. He graciously took a few photos with us and did not seemed rushed at all despite it being a full house at dinner service.Billy, the GM, was amazing. We noticed thru the dark windows there were rooms in the upper levels. When we inquired about it, he did not hesitate to take us around. He was warm and friendly. It was wonderful to have him excitedly showing us around his home and proudly telling us about the history of EMP. Ask to see the Sol LeWitt room. Sadly, all things come to an end. When you leave your enchanted evening, notice the black step as you depart: it's ground down equipment from the original kitchen (Daniel Turner). But wait! It DOESN'T END when you leave. How can I not mention Humm's takeaway gift of subtly sweet and crunchy granola that tastes like ""something this good shouldn't be good for me, but it's granola so it must be?"" Hubby foolishly left his on the counter a day too long and within my reach and so I helpfully finished it for him.One of the things that struck me about Chef Humm is his quiet unassuming humility: in his presence, his food and his restaurant. I mean, he lets you step on ART for goodness sake! There isn't a giant plaque besides these pieces either, but the art are so beautiful you can't help but notice them and ask more about them. I'm sure there were more surprises I failed to mention, but that leaves an excuse to return for another trip! It is on my list of favorites! I hope all Yelpers get a chance to experience this magnificent masterpiece!"
55,5.0 star rating,"Had an incredible experience here! We came for a late night reservation and were seated right away in a booth on the floor. We did the 10 course menu that started with a cute box of black and white cookies. They put a twist on it with a slightly tart and tangy flavor added and was a nice way to start off the meal. It continued with a summer tomato theme with these dosas and a selection of dipping sauces and a tomato tea. It was all very unique and savory. This followed with a bowl of tiny tomatoes. I'm usually not a huge fan of whole tomatoes but this was cooked in a way that the flavor wasn't too overpowering. For the third course, they pushed out a tray with delicate corn soufflé and plated the dish table side and added caviar on top and bonito cream on the side. I loved how it was slightly sweet and creamy from the corn but salty from the caviar and bonito.The next course we could choose and I went with the foie gras seared and it was absolutely amazing. Again, the flavor was very subtle but rich and nicely charred. The next appetizer was lobster wrapped in a thin leaf while my boyfriend got the sea bass. Immediately following was the snails course which was a lot of fun. They pushed in a cart with a grill to continue cooking the snails kebab right in front of you. When it was done, you wrapped it in lettuce and can add 4 different types of sauces. I really liked this one! I love escargots and this was done in such a creative and delicious way. They also came out with this complimentary bread with the most amazing butter that they offered to refill if you wanted. The mains took a while to come out - I got the duck and my boyfriend got the steak. It came with two sides to share - a creamed corn and zucchini that were great on their own as well! Even with all the small portion sizes, we were getting pretty full by this point. The dessert courses started with this creme filled brioche that came with two savory dipping sauces. We then both chose to get the chocolate sherbet desserts which were perfect! Finally, they ended up giving out this tier with two pretzels and a bottle of brandy, which you could finish if you wanted to but that bottle was very, very strong - I could only take one sip. To top off the amazing experience, they gave us two goody bags with jars of granola and the menu in those cute case! Overall a really well done and delicious meal."
56,5.0 star rating,"The cuisine and attention to detail were amazing and I highly recommend. In my opinion worth every penny. At the end of the meal they even gave us some personalized takeaways including signed menus, granola, and an Eleven Madison onesie (since I am 8.5 months pregnant). Extremely thoughtful and appreciated! It was certainly a special evening. My only criticism (and it could do with where we were sitting) is the vibe is more business dinner then romantic date. If that sort of thing is important to you I would head to Blue Hill at Stone Barns."
57,5.0 star rating,"The most amazing experience from even before my husband and I stepped foot into the restaurant till we walked out.When asked what we liked the best, we could not answer.  The dishes got better with each course.The restaurant team were all amazing.  Especially our waiter, Will.  He really made our experience special.We enjoyed the Fall menu, would love to return for the other seasons."
58,5.0 star rating,"Flavor packed in every bite, excellent service and an unpretentious atmosphere all come together for a fabulous experience The plating encourages you to ""play"" with your food, try different combos and just enjoy yourself. The foie was absolutely amazing and the duck was faultless.  Extensive wine menu with a sohm on hand to make sure it all gets to you as it should. We will be back!"
59,2.0 star rating,"It is fine, but it is not worth the expense in any way.  I've had a much better experience at lower end establishments like the Modern and Gramercy Tavern.  I would 100% recommend either of these restaurants instead.  The staff was spectacular, but there were only 2 dishes that met their reputation as the best restaurant.  I wouldn't have even rated this experience as top 15, let alone #1. I've been here before and it didn't meet my expectations then either.  It wasn't worth second chance.  They do have a nice selection of wines."
60,5.0 star rating,"If you're going to splurge this is definitely the place to do it. This place checks off all the boxes, nice ambiance, great service, amazing food, and will most definitely wow you for that special occasion. We came here for my birthday and had a reservation a month before, the earliest they had was for 9:30pm. Don't make any plans for after dinner if you have a late reservation because this isn't going to be a quick meal. You come here for the culinary experience. Each bite takes you on a journey. Some flavors even too overwhelming for my palette. My favorite dishes had to be the sturgeon caviar topped on a corn soufflé and the foie gras. 3 Michelin well deserved."
61,5.0 star rating,"Been around the block a time or two. And, this is one of hose places you just have to go to. The playing of your dishes is lively. A feast for the eyes. Great service, interesting dishes, good cocktails."
62,5.0 star rating,"Just wow.I've been in the hospitality industry for 17 years with the last 14 of them in management (including fine dining upper management) and I can easily without a doubt say that I was blown away by the hospitality from the staff at EMP, an experience second to none.Visiting from California and having wanted to experience the famed Eleven Madison Park for quite some time(yet not having fought for a reservation a month in advance), my fiancée and I entered near the tail end of brunch just yesterday, greeted kindly by Annalisa(sp) at the door, and were allowed to sneak into the bar/lounge area for an impromptu quick bite and drink to get a peek of what they had to offer.Our experience was nothing short of exemplary:We sat at the bar top where we were promptly greeted by L.J.(sp), one of the two bartenders for the day. He was very kind and helpfully guided us through any questions we had about the drinks and informed us of the food options available a la carte.I asked about some of the spirits on the top shelf, Matt, the other bartender on, was quick to answer a few questions I had and was very friendly as well.We ordered two cocktails, promptly made by L.J.. Creative ingredients, perfectly balanced with nuance and thoughtfulness, they were delicious! Quickly jumped into the highest tier of cocktails I've had NY or otherwise - and I'm an incredibly tough critic on the inside when it comes to cocktails, though I'll always be nice externally.We decided to order the Steak Tartare with Foie Gras, and the Herb crusted Duck Breast to share.The tartare was served in a bone marrow presentation and entirely capped with Foie. That was easily the best steak tartare I've ever had. The accompanying bread was perfectly prepared for texture and flavor.In between courses we were served some of their bread rolls- lightly flakey yet firm, hint of cheese on top and served with their in-house cultured butter thats topped with a toasted cheese crumble and was excellent.Then the duck came. Minimalist plating, duck breast alongside an onion disk that was baked with blueberries on top, then table side the accompanying sauce is added while being described to you. It was fantastic. My fiancée quickly said it was the best duck she's ever tried. I agree- it was the most elegant duck plate I've had, again very thoughtful flavor combinations with the peppercorn and coriander crust beautifully weaving through the flavor profile.Throughout our time at the bar top we had an excellent time chatting up L.J., he was very personable and extremely attentive. We told him much about our trip to NY and our places of interest, spoke about cocktails and the industry in general- he was very kind and accommodating. Near the end of our dish he stepped out of the bar for a moment.. didn't think much of it of course. However as soon as our dish was done we were approached by Annalisa. She kindly inquired about our experience thus far- to which our reply was of course nothing but delicious and excellent. She then asked if we would be interested in taking a tour of the newly renovated kitchen and back of house operations.. we excitedly and surprisingly obliged. Annalisa guided us through the diningroom and into their back of house staging area where the final steps are put into place before items reach the tables. Then into the main kitchen area, just off to the side was a small counter set up with two settings where we were led. There we had a central look at the huge expanse of the kitchen- it was truly impressive. We were poured a small glass of water each and introduced to Keenan(sp) who was a pastry chef there. In front of us he prepared a small palate cleanser ice cream bite which was literally constructed in front of us. We were instructed to take it in a single bite- it was savory and bright. There we stayed for several minuted as Annalisa outlined the different areas and operations of the kitchen, answering any questions we had and allowing us to take it all in (it's huge.. I mean seriously huge). Afterwards we were guided through the pastry end of the kitchen and back to our bar seats. We thanked her graciously for her time and information- she was wonderful. Now back at the bar, a small dessert arrives for each of us from behind- completely unbeknownst to us. An elegant chocolate and coffee bite for me and a multi component raspberry & ice cream bite for her. They were both delicious and well suited for our tastes.My fiancée and I look at each other and just can't believe the outstanding and wonderful experience that we've just been through from our impromptu drop-in. Never could I have imagined the level of courtesy, hospitality, respect, kindness, and genuine friendliness that we happened upon.L.J., Annalisa, and Matt, thank you for an unforgettable experience.Eleven Madison Park is doing it right and doing it exceptionally well. The stars (from any and all sources) are well deserved."
63,3.0 star rating,"I went to EMP to celebrate my birthday but it fell a bit short on my expectations....I went in with very high expectations for the #1 restaurant in the world but the service was just not on par compare to other Michelin stars that I had been to in nyc. The overall experience is pretty good, however I don't think it was the best food or most memorable experience I've ever had. Most importantly, I FOUND A PIECE OF HAIR IN MY DRINK. I had to flag down my waiter and he was able to change it for me. A bit later towards the end of the meal, a tiny tiny tiny bug flew into my cheese course... so I just stop eating. I had the Dining Room summer Tasting menu. Tomato soup, Foie gras, lobster, snails were amazing. Pan seared foie gras was so buttery and juicy, it was one of my fav of all time. The summer menu though consists of a lot of tomatoes.. like a lot of tomatoes."
64,5.0 star rating,"I held off on writing this review for 2 months because I could not find the words to describe my experience at Eleven Madison. I'm still having a hard time :P We came here a few days after dining at Le Bernardin, where we had a fantastic meal comprised of our favorite food: seafood. We came in with no expectations because we didn't think this meal could be that much better than Le Bernardin. Boy, was I wrong! On a scale of 1-10, this place is 100. From the wonderful service to the exquisite food, everything was pure perfection. We had 10pm reservations, but we were running about 20 minutes late. I thought for sure we blew it because we'd be rushed and the food wouldn't be as good. Nope. At no point were we rushed by any of the staff. In fact, our server asked if we wanted to tour the kitchen before our dining experience came to and end. How fantastic???Each dish was so beautiful and the flavors took us on an adventure. There are times where I'm disappointed in dishes on a tasting menu, but Eleven Madison blew my mind with each one. Everything was absolute PERFECTION, I tell ya. We opted for the wine pairing which was the best EVER! I didn't think any pairing could beat Benu's, but Eleven Madison takes the cake. Our Advanced Sommelier, Sam, was so great in explaining each wine and how they will pair with each dish. He was also incredibly kind and friendly. Ryan and I are rooting for you, Sam! Hope you are a Master Sommelier when we see you next :)If you are hesitant about dining here because of the price, get over it! It's honestly worth every penny. Truly a culinary experience."
65,4.0 star rating,"As a foodie this is probably one of those must go places.  Since this is a 3-stars Michelin restaurant it is best reserve for special occasions.  I booked this meal for my husband's birthday and it was a great experience.   I don't think I have even prepaid any meals in my lifetime but hey there's first time for everything.  So I booked the Bar tasting menu.  When we arrived out table was not ready but the hostess make sure we were comfortable and seated in the waiting area.  She was pleasant and approachable as not being stuffy as I would imagine a place of 3-star Michelin would be.  Later we were told that our bar table would not be ready in time and hey upgraded us to the dining room and also from 5 to 8 tasting menu.  Who would say no to that! It is a Nuevo cuisine restaurant which means it is traditional in the sense that it is small plate, taste and presentation in such that it is about quality and not quantity.  The wine pairing and the choices of their wine is far most the most impressive thing about this place! I think the food is great but the wine it excellent.  We were told tonight was the first summer tasting menu so I have to say it was perfect.  So why the 4 but not 5 stars? Well I am not going to lie, this was wonderful but I was still hungry after this very expensive meal.  It is neuvo cuisine after all."
66,5.0 star rating,Great place to enjoy great company with excellent food. Really enjoyed the art the chef prepared.
67,5.0 star rating,"This was one of my favorite tasting menu experiences. It was fancy but still managed to feel upbeat and relaxed. Everything we had was delicious and unique. The staff was fun and the presentation of everything was incredible. Not to mention we were sent away with a tin that we ate out of earlier full of our menu, and a big jar of granola for breakfast! My absolute favorites of the night were the egg salad asparagus and snow pea fish egg starters, the bread (tasted like a croissant!), the incredible caviar course with a savory cheesecake and everything bagel crust, my amazing spring salad, the lobster, the table grilled snails with morels, and my mom's chocolate dessert! At the end of our meal we also received a chocolate pretzel and a small glass of apple cider that was the perfect thing to end on! Loved this place. Super duper satisfied and had a lot of fun :)"
68,5.0 star rating,Not much else to add beyond the glowing reviews already written here. I appreciate the tone of the presentation. There is a wink to a couple of the courses that help breathe fresh air to the experience.
69,5.0 star rating,"Great place to splurge or celebrate a special occasion. Or go for a regular dinner if you are baller like that. Ranked #1 restaurant in 2017 worldwide and #4 restaurant in 2018, it definitely shows in your experience there. The 3 Michelin stars don't hurt either. // LOCATION // across from Madison Square Park (not garden!)// SERVICE // impeccable, while casual and not pretentious. You never feel like it's a stuffy environment which we loved. // FOOD // 10 courses focused on seasonal offerings and smattered with fun surprises along the way. We had the spring menu and we loved some of the Asian influences including the use of black sesame and ginger."
70,2.0 star rating,"I've been to a lot of fine dining restaurants and this is probably the worst fine dining experience I've ever had. The food was very mediocre and the service was even worse. The servers were pretty cold. Especially we went to Per Se the day before, and the service we received was just more than perfect. People there were very warm and genuine. However we didn't feel that way at eleven Madison. It feels like the servers didn't even want to talk to us at all. And after the dinner, we had really bad stomachache. This never happened to us with any other fine dining restaurants. The restaurant is overrated and doesn't deserve what we paid. I'm very disappointed"
71,4.0 star rating,"We came here for dinner this past weekend. It has been a few years since we've been here but remembered how creative in taste and presentation it was, so was really excited. They also reno the restaurant last summer so curious how it looked.  The restaurant appearance seems a bit more simplistic than before but when you have super high ceilings, column-free, and large windows like that I guess not much needs to be done.  The service was near impeccable. A couple of times when we returned to the table there should have been someone to pull the table out to let my partner back into the seat.  The food, which included lobster,lamb and duck, was very good but fell short of expectations. Nothing really blew us away - taste or presentation. And if you don't eat any bread, which is excellent, one might not feel very full.  FYI - they no longer have the Gruyere Gougeres (we call it cheese puffs) so that was disappointing.  We ordered 3 wines by the glass that went well with the meal so likely a better option than the $175 wine pairing for many wines you might not be familiar with or varietals and blends you dont care for.  We went to Jean George last year and to us that was more of a Michelin 3-star worthy/top rated restaurant in the world experience.  We also went to Le Cinq (also top Michelin rated) in Paris last year and that was a superior gastro experience to Eleven Madison and worthy of the price and accolades, so make sure you reserve early if you plan on going there.  We'll go back to Le Cinq and Jean George. Eleven Madison, maybe we'll go back again in a few years."
72,5.0 star rating,Definitely deserving of all three stars. Staff are extremely attentive to the point where one could be concerned (as if they hired mentalists). Definitely will make Eleven a regular stop every time I'm in NYC.
73,5.0 star rating,Excellent food and service without a strict dress code. Couldn't ask for more.
74,5.0 star rating,"I have been fortunate enough to dine at Eleven Madison Park two times, both enjoying the wine and dinner pairing. I must say that this is one of the finest resteraunt a I have encountered, and I am an avid traveler. They truly live up to the hype and the service is far superior to any resteraunt I have seen. We counted nearly 50 different employees attending to our every need. The water ninjas as I like to call them are literally magical! I must have drank four glasses but the water but never saw my glass being filled! I you are lucky enough to go it is worth it on every level!"
75,5.0 star rating,"Ethereal.  Have the good fortune to have been to many of the best restaurants around the globe, specifically NYC.  I can say without reservation EMP is top 10.  This restaurant gets as close to perfection as one can expect - at the cost you would have the highest expectations, EMP exceeds.  Service is attentive, not imposing, food is creative, seasonal and simply delicious.  Each dish leaves you wanting the next.Will not disappoint, this is a must.Abbreviated explanation - go for the experience in its entirety, return for the granola.  If there were a food equivalent of the most addicting drug equivalent food, their take home granola is crack reincarnate"
76,5.0 star rating,Beautiful place. Great food. The staff is amazing. Thanks Diego.  I appreciate your hospitality!!!!
77,5.0 star rating,"This place has amazing service and food that accentuates all flavors and taste buds! The wine list was fantastic! I would suggest the duck as well! Overall, it deserves its spot on the top 50 restaurants in the world. I have been following this list for years and would say at number one, I have yet gone to a restaurant that's beat it!"
78,5.0 star rating,"My wife and I had the Dining Room Tasting Menu + wine pairing in January 2018.  Hands down one of the top restaurants on our list.  You know it's good when you wake up dreaming about what you ate the night before.  Awesome service, each course was memorable, wine pairings bucked the stereotypical pairings from average somms, more generous wine pours than other high end restaurants, and there's enough spacing between tables such that the conversations from neighbors was not that noticeable.  I only wish the restaurant was a bit more intimate and not so cavernous.  --  Slowly chasing the #Worlds50BestRestaurants..."
79,5.0 star rating,"So hard to get into, but so worth the drama and the wait. After contacting the restaurant for their next round of reservations, I was clicking on the computer seconds before the clock struck to ensure I got a reservation and obviously.....GOOOAAALLLL! (You have to be a soccer fan to understand the point I am making).For those of you who cannot get a reservation, they do have a bar area that looked really live and for the most part, you do have the same menu,  just not as many dishes due to the lack of space. Some dishes come with quite the presentation which you should expect. I scored a tour of the kitchen and I was so appreciative as the experience never gets old. They had row upon row of ducks hanging and it reminded me of an image you might see in a cartoon except this image was very real and I knew within a short period of time, I would be dining on one of those ducks. The entire staff that I came into contact with were very professional and courteous. Rene was my server and she was wonderful. They definitely know how to take care of their guests which was shocking to discover that they do not accept gratuity! I have dined all over the world as some of the most exquisite restaurants and this is the first time that I have encountered one of this quality where gratuity was not necessary. The food was exquisite and while there is no need to go into detail about every dish as the menu changes seasonally, the lavender crusted duck was magnificent. The flavors....wow.So, Eleven stares the #1 spot with French Laundry, except the biggest difference is at FL, they gave me so many desserts, I felt like I was Marie Antoinette and I was in heaven as dessert is so my thing. Eleven is way more conservative on this point. I had a choice of 1 dessert, I also got their infamous delish chocolate covered pretzel with a shot of apple brandy and to go, I was presented with their granola with blueberries which I savored over the course of 2 days. Um, can I buy this granola on a regular basis? It's that damn good!Eleven is such a treat and I hope to be able to make it a yearly tradition to dine here."
80,3.0 star rating,"Every dish was too salty for me, even the ice cream.  The hosts were very friendly, but they walked around too often to check if you need anything- which made me feel a little uncomfortable."
81,5.0 star rating,In one word. Perfection. I was surprised with a lunch for my 30th birthday so I wasn't exactly dressed to impress and the weather was crappy. The hostess that greeted us at the door could see I was a little uneasy and assured me they did not have a dress code not to fret.The atmosphere is like entering into another world and you get a glimpse of the chefs mind through their food and creative interpretations.The staff and service was flawless from beginning to end. If you ever get the opportunity to try this place treat yo'self and do so!!!
82,4.0 star rating,"This place has plenty of people who work here. Nice people who smile but at points can look really stressed or body guard like. But our servers were nice, the previous comment was my observations of other servers running around. Pour water nicely and place silverware and plating symmetrically. Ask any of the servers a question about the food and they'll know where it's from.The 5 course:1.Caviar, ham, green jello, Benedict sauce, egg yolk, and homemade English muffin.2. House break, tasted like croissants and the butter had cheese crumbles, that was yum.3. Salad, I had ceviche, bf and his dad had the liver. We all tasted each other's, and I liked the salad the most, then ceviche, then liver. Kris (bf) said the strawberry is too strong in the liver. 4. Lobster claw. Very delicious!5. Main dish: 2 dishes lamb and the other 2 duck breast. I love the lamb, had two different parts: one fatty and the other shredded. The duck breast was super delicious as well.6. Ended with dessert: chocolate, strawberry, and cheese (goat). All separate dishes, my fav was the strawberry. We didn't understand why it took roughly 15 minutes longer or shorter between dishes. Maybe space for talking? How cool would it be if there was an option to choose how fast you want the food to come out after each or when ready"
83,5.0 star rating,"Wow wow wow, what a place. The food is out of this world it may be the best restaurant in the city. The experience is out of this world. I can't wait to go back.. the service is a 10 also."
84,2.0 star rating,"Finally we have decided to try out this claimed world number one restaurant! We had very high expectation for EMP! But the experience is disappointing, I hate to say that. Compared to other Michelin restaurants we had before, this one definitely is not worth the price, $400 pp without wine pairing. After left the restaurant, I barely remember any dishes we had without looking at the photo we took. And we had four dishes of daikon. They mentioned that the theme of tonight is spring, so spring equals daikon? Unfortunately, I won't come back and recommend my friends to spend time and money on it."
85,5.0 star rating,"The spring/summer menu heavily features seasonal greens such as asparagus and pea. All the dishes are wonderfully arranged and presented. My favorite are the foie gras and the duck. The peppercorn & cumin seasoning for the latter is simply amazing! I casually brought up that I like mint chocolate flavor during the dessert course, and was surprised with a mint hot chocolate soon after. That was such a sweet gesture! The decor is lovely as well, and most certainly rounds out our nice experience."
86,2.0 star rating,"After 4+ years of living in New York and countless restaurant experiences that ranged from the good to the bad to the ugly, I finally decided to join Yelp after eating at Eleven Madison Park.  While I don't consider myself a ""foodie"" by any means, I do get to eat at the fancier NYC restaurants by virtue of my job, so I'd like to think I'm not a total rube.  I read a lot of reviews prior to going to EMP to get a better idea of what to expect, and I have to assume there is a certain degree of confirmation bias involved when reflecting on a meal that cost upwards of $500 pp, because no one wants to admit that they spent a fortune on an unremarkable experience.  EMP was certainly an experience unlike any I've ever had, but when it comes down to it the food was not outstanding and, I hate to say it... disappointing.  Leaving, I couldn't name a single dish that wowed me or that left me wanting to come back.  This also may be colored by the fact that the waitstaff gave me the same feeling I get when I'm followed around a store (fellow people of color will know what I mean), and I'm also pretty sure I got food poisoning but more on that later.THE GOOD:The day before our reservation, the restaurant reached out to ask if we were celebrating anything special.  We didn't respond, but did share what we were celebrating and got a very cute gift related to that after our meal.All of the waitstaff was super knowledgable and attentive, and answered silly questions we had about the MetLife building and what was going on at other tables.  The highlight of our night was watching the waitstaff very capably escort out a table of very drunk patrons.The wine pairing was very very good, with flavors that coordinated remarkably with the food.The decor and ambiance is very pretty.The wine pours are heavy! I didn't drink much, but definitely understood how that table got so drunk.  Plus, the last course comes with a bottle of apple brandy to drink to your heart's desire.THE BADI don't know if we looked less affluent than the other guests (or perhaps more brown?), but every time we asked a question about what was going on at another table the servers acted like we were trying to scam our way into getting something for free.  Just expressing some curiosity! You would too if you saw the crazy stuff going on around the dining room! The food seemed targeted at a non-NYC audience, with kitschy dishes like a savory black and white cookie and a play on a lox bagel in the form of a cheesecake served with caviar.  I'm not a fan of touristy experiences, but if you are this may be a pro.While the dishes all had unique flavors, some were outright bland.  The fluke and bass for example were really lacking in the flavor department.You leave with a printed out menu and some EMP granola.  The next morning, I felt a little funny and ate some granola, thinking I was just hungry.  I then had some pretty bad stomach issues, and since everything I ate in the prior 12+ hours was from EMP I'm pretty sure it was something I ate.  Although I did have wine, I didn't drink very much and left the dinner sober so it was not a hangover.Overall, if EMP is on your bucket list for the experience you should go.  But if you're more concerned with food than theatre when you eat,   you can get a better meal at a peer (or even less prestigious) restaurant.  I also can't shake the feeling of being othered, so if you're a POC I hope you leave feeling differently, but here's some fair warning that you may be looked at sideways."

88,5.0 star rating,"There isn't much more that can be added - Eleven Madison Park lives up to its hype without question.The meal and service was outstanding. We were asking many questions and engaged with the staff and they obviously appreciated it much. We were able to go back into the kitchen and try some off-menu items which was a nice, personal touch to the evening. The food was excellent but the staff makes the experience. If you have the opportunity and ability to dine here, do it (and book in advance)."

90,5.0 star rating,"We dined at EMP tonight to celebrate a birthday. Let me begin by saying there are many reasons why EMP is the World's Best restaurant. While the food is absolutely delicious, full of fresh ingredients and with innovative flavors, it is the service and attention to details that stand out the most. The EMP staff is Phenomenal!!!! Absolutely Phenomenal! This is most well managed and run restaurant I have ever been to. The restaurant runs smoothly with high attention to details. Everything is perfection. When we first arrived, we were greeted by our first names. We were welcomed by many lovely EMP staff members- all were smiling and welcoming. When you walk into the restaurant, you notice the interior is simple yet elegant. Beautiful purple flowers were in the dining room tonight as well as sophisticated artwork hanging on the walls. It is airy and bright inside. EMP is not stuffy or haughty. The atmosphere is relaxed and calm. Once inside we were seated immediately to begin dinner. My friend was greeted with a Happy Birthday card at the table. EMP staff came over to wish her well. This alone was very personable and greatly appreciated. The drink menu is extensive with wines, cocktails, tea, coffees to choose from. We sampled two non- alcohol drinks to start the night.  Both were lovely and flavorful. We had the ""bar menu"". This was a delicious 5 course experience of caviar, lamb, duck, lobster and other fresh seasonal vegetables. To finish we enjoyed dessert and chocolate pretzels. Every plate was absolute perfection. Beyond perfection! Clean to taste, spices and herbs were all delicately placed on the dishes, sauces were perfect- not heavy or salty. In fact, the sauces added just the right amount of ""kick"" to each plate. Also I found each plate was the right size serving. When the plates arrived to the table, the staff promptly noted the dish and all of the ingredients while presenting. Overall just perfection. Our evening was made even more special because we were so honored to tour the kitchen and meet Chef Dmitri. He is lovely! Very funny and warm. This moment really was just outstanding. Just a beautiful moment for us as guests to recognize the accomplishments of the Chef and kitchen staff. We each left with a jar of granola. I assure you- this is the best granola you will ever eat.Our experience tonight exceeded expectations! Eleven Madison Park is truly the World's best! The best staff, the best most delicious food, and the best dining experience you will ever have!"
91,5.0 star rating,Went for a drink in the bar/lounge area tonight. Everything was impeccable - worthy of the highest praise. We loved it. Well done to you all.Hadn't been there since the renovation and expansion of the area adjacent to the bar.
92,2.0 star rating,"Bland, everything about this restaurant is bland. We were in town for a short vacation, and were so excited about getting to experience this so called number one restaurant in the world! What a shame it only left us with disappointment. Food was below average standard of Michelin 3 star restaurants. New York alone we have visited Le Bernadine, Jean George and Daniels when they were still 3 stars. Food wise Daniels was not as good but still better than 11 Madison Park......Almost everything was sour, from the beginning to just before main dish, and the sesame dessert didn't have any taste other than sourness. The snail dish was the worst, while snail was stiff and chewy, with seasoning that's not really working. One of the snail was not cleaned properly and had ""dirt"" that tasted bitter.I could accept the duck dish as duck meat was cooked alright, while my mom absolutely hated the crispy seasoning on top of duck skin.If without the pictures I took of the food, I would have already forgotten what I have eaten tonight......Apart from food, the atmosphere was more casual compared to other Michelin 3 star restaurants, which is just a matter of preference. Interior decor is bland, nothing adds any characteristics to the space that's worth comment on. As an interior designer, I don't like the way they have the tables placed, boring and awkward. Service is nothing special, definitely not as detailed as the French ones. Waiters are a bit chaotic, and with the way of the tables were placed, the whole time you can see how chaotic they were...... I like the restaurants where you don't see the waiters for most of your dining period, but they always appear magically whenever they need to. Overall, we really don't understand why it was ranked number one, nor Michelin 3 stars. Food was not very bad, but nothing I would refer to as delicious, unfortunately. I will not return and will suggest my friends to spend their money and time elsewhere."

Lots of email exchanges (too many) for in the end a limited follow-through on my request.The seven course tasting menu was good if not inventive and the service was attentive. Unfortunately, the event managers missed some of the requests. The price, however, was at the rendez-vous. Perhaps the restaurant (and not the events/private dining section) is the way to go here....."

96,3.0 star rating,"Eleven Madison Park pre-renovation used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the world. I was excited to return to Eleven Madison Park post-renovation, especially with its newly appointed status as the world's best restaurant. Also exciting me was that this would be my 50th Michelin Star restaurant visit, so it felt appropriate that the grandest restaurant of them all would be the destination for this occasion. Previously, I had loved the menu, but found service and ambiance too stiff. With this visit, I was pleased to find a new casual vibe to the whole experience, but with all the magic lost from the food.The Good: - Service is now much more casual and friendly compared to my previous visit, and the new dining room is beautiful. I love the more relaxed environment. - Standout dishes were the taste of spring appetizers and the duck. Both were very well prepared and tasty dishes.- The team prepared a special gift for my new job, which was very cute and much appreciated!The Not So Good: - Everything I loved about the previous Eleven Madison Park food-wise has been lost. The whimsy and fun that made this restaurant special-- the carrot grinder, pretzel basket, etc.-- is completely gone, as if this is a whole different restaurant completely. The menu now feels a lot more traditional in its technique and focus, and is a lot more heavy overall despite having a lot less courses than the previous iteration of Eleven Madison Park. Presentation was lacking in my opinion.- Some dishes were really a miss for me unfortunately. Three people at my table deemed the goat cheese dessert inedible because the pungent flavor. The main course of snails and morels also had an unappealing flavor, akin to ""dirt"" by one person at my table. The lobster was tough and chewy, and the savory desserts were an unappealing end to such a heavy menu. - Service lapses. Though the service is (at times overly) friendly, there were a lot of service lapses that you shouldn't be seeing at a 3 Michelin Star restaurant, let alone the World's Best Restaurant. My water was frequently switched between sparkling and still, despite a reminder that I ordered sparkling. Chairs were not pulled out when returning to the table, and one time my napkin wasn't even folded when leaving the table. Dishes were served to the wrong people at the table twice, and plates were not set nor taken in synchronicity. Servers also stumbled over their words quite a bit; we're all human, but that is not quite the level of polish you'd expect here. Now, I know some of these things sound like pretentious quips, but these are things you'd expect to operate flawlessly as this caliber of restaurant and it'd be unfair to not point it out. - I have some more subjective issues with the visit as well. You now have to make decisions on what you want for 4 courses, and I think it'd be a lot easier to provide some sort of menu for these choices instead of a waiter verbally presenting them because it's hard to digest (no pun intended) that many choices. Service was also overly compensating at times, as mentioned above. I love friendly and personable service, but there was a lack of the traditional professionalism I'd expect to see at this caliber of restaurant. Overall, I was disappointed in my visit to Eleven Madison Park. I have such fond memories of my previous visit, and although I love and embrace changes and evolutions to restaurants, I wouldn't even consider this the same restaurant as pre-renovation Eleven Madison Park. The food was the most disappointing aspect; even if it is not my preferred style of food, there were too many objective issues with the food as listed above. Service was really friendly, but it pales in comparison objectively to my other 3-Michelin Star experiences with all the misses mentioned above. Unfortunately, I will not be returning any time soon. Ambiance: 8/10Service: 6/10Food: 4/10Overall: 6/10"
97,3.0 star rating,"I honestly can't write an in-depth description of each and every dish that we received.  I can say that the only reason this does have three stars is because of the service provided.  For such an expensive meal, each dish was good, not great.  I just feel like creativity fell dead here.  There were three interesting platings out of a series.  We were served chicken, fish, cheesecake with caviar.  Listen, don't get me wrong, it was GOOD.  Was it worth the money?  Was I awed as I was expected to be?  That's a hard no."
98,5.0 star rating,"At the risk of sounding Pollyanna-ish and adding one more unnecessary 5 stars review, I will say that the meal was expectedly great and the service was truly flawless. What topped it was our server overhearing us talk about applesauce and towards the end of the meal surprised us with an in-house version that was the best applesauce I've ever had."
99,4.0 star rating,"Perhaps my anticipation for the meal got the better of me. Reservations are definitely hard to come by as they were snatched up instantly--FYI available on first of every month at 9am EST for the following month (ie July opens up on June 1st). If you mark your calendar (set an alert) and are prompt about making a reservation (literally watch when it hits 9 am and know exactly when you want to book), it's not impossible.Having given the title of number 1 restaurant in the world 2017, I think my expectations were too high. All the food was good, but nothing that would make me want to come back again or insist that other people try. They don't give you a menu of the food like a couple of the other three Michelin Star restaurants I've been to so I am unsure of all the dishes I had but the spring tasting menu included things such asLobster with dandelion greensRoasted duck Cheesecake with everything bagel crust and sturgeon caviar (probably the best and interesting thing I had there)Snails and morelsFoie Gras (sweet or savory option--husband preferred the savory one) FlukeTake home: blueberry granola Service was fantastic, as expected. I truly wanted to give this restaurant a rave review, but overall I was a bit disappointed. I think if you go into it without any expectation, you will probably have a better experience. Food: 4/5 stars (food for price point: 3.5 stars) Service: 5/5 starsI haven't been to many other 3 Star Michelin restaurants (Le bernadin, Alinea, Gordon Ramsey, Geranium), but I'm starting to think that three star doesn't really mean it's worth making a trip just to eat at a particular restaurant (but Alinea is worth going to more than once)."

101,5.0 star rating,"Can anyone give Eleven Madison Park less than 5 stars? Eleven Madison Park has been ranked the number one restaurant in the world and is the holder of 3 Michelin Stars so who am I to give it less than 5 stars (for a Yelp review). Eleven Madison Park is a exactly what you would expect from a 3 Michelin Stars restaurant. The detail to the service, food and cocktails are exceptional. The spacious art deco decor of the restaurant adds to the atmosphere - invokes an air of grandeur that is fitting for the production that will unfold over the 3 hour tasting menu.Daniel Humm's cooking is heart of the hallowed Eleven Madison Park. He is a neo-classicist, a master of pruning the old-fashioned curlicues from the traditional haute cuisine of his training to make the pleasures more modern and direct. We tried the spring tasting menu. Some of the highlights included: (1) cheesecake with smoke sturgeon caviar, (2) lobster butter poached with ginger and dandelion greens, (3) snails grilled with morels and ramps, and (4) lamb with fava bean relish and nepitella.  The dishes were all innovative and creative. It was essentially art on a plate. Dining at Eleven Madison Park will set you back $315 (US) per person (before cocktails). It is definitely worth the price if you enjoy food and fine dining.  Eleven Madison Park is one of the best. I have been asked how Eleven Madison Park compared to other 3 Michelin Stars restaurants such as Per Se, Le Bernardin, Jean-Georges, Joel Robuchon and Alain Ducasse. It is difficult to compare. I enjoyed all of these restaurants. There were dishes that were unique to each of these restaurants that I enjoyed. All of these 3 Michelin Stars restaurants were worth the money paid.  What you have to keep in mind is that a 3 Michelin Stars restaurant is a production - it is the opportunity to experience some of the best dishes prepared by some of the best Chefs in the industry."
102,3.0 star rating,Very disappointed! I thought it would be the best food in the world and I honestly can pick several restaurants with way better food! The experience was excellent though and staff was courteous! Nothing against anybody there but don't expect to have the best food it is just very tiny portions of different things!
103,1.0 star rating,"Before I start I want to put out there that I consider myself a foodie. I have been to French Laundy, Daniel,  La Bernadine, Del Posto, Nomad, Gagan in Bangkok, etc. I experienced 11 Madison Park first many years ago and it stayed with me as an amazing experience. We had dinner April 8 and I've toyed with weather I should write this review.  My recent trip there was a huge disappointment at best. I bought this as an engagement gift for my fiancé. For the hype(best in the world?) and the price I was so excited to take him as he's never been. I talked it up so much. The new dining room is pretty and nice bar. The service was good nothing stellar. The food was...ok. Not bad but not mind blowing. Duck was a bit dry. The cheese dish was so rich and salty.  Honestly I can't even remember the other dishes and they should not be forgettable. This goes down as one of life's big disappointments. Was really expecting to be wowed. Would have preferred Del Posto or Nomad for much less. Feel like I should do a do over just to make sure it wasn't a one off but not for that price. Ruined my opinion forever:(."
104,5.0 star rating,"Best meal ever, best service ever, best way to spend our anniversary! (HUGE shout out to Blair who put up with our endless questions and entertained our requests all night with a smile on his face.) I am absolutely impressed by how customized our meals were during each and every course. The food was exquisite. If you are ever in NY and enjoy good food, GO HERE! Chef Daniel Humm has such artistic abilities, talents, and vision. Also check out the kitchen, it's phenomenal!!!"
105,4.0 star rating,"A second visit on a beautiful spring day revealed a comfortable temperature inside.  I guess that this is a spot worth visiting when it's not really, really cold outside, because the inside temperature seems to match."
106,5.0 star rating,"This is actually one of my first fine dining experiences about a decade ago lol it was a first date and we are actually still friends til this day .... impeccable food and drinks , I still remember I have a fancy Shirley  temple because I was not old enough to drink lol I remember the halibut and the petite filet mignon and it was incredibly tender ... I'll definitely be back soon ..."
107,5.0 star rating,I hosted a couple of clients at Eleven Madison last month and we had a great experience. The service as attentive and friendly. The food was excellent. The space is big and beautiful. I prefer L'Appart for a date or special occasion but Eleven Madison was fantastic for a 4-hour business dinner.
108,5.0 star rating,"The setting is beautiful and the presentation if spectacular. Now and then it felt a little over the top, but all in all the sequencing of the meal was perfect, the service fantastic, the flavors very good, and the plates were beautiful. We we invited back into the kitchen for a tour and a treat. The tour was fun but the treat was, well, the real treat. Amazing truffle cream filled roasted cone. A side note, we were given gifts of granola at the end of the meal. I didn't think much of it but when I woke up hungry in the morning and had some, I was very happy. Best granola ever."
109,5.0 star rating,Exceptional. Ranks with the best we have done so far Gagnaire or L'Astrance. Amazing atmosphere quite laid back compared to French 3 stars with fantastic service.
110,5.0 star rating,"I mean come on... anyone that has given Eleven Madison Park anything less then 5 stars is just odd... My fiancé and I absolutely love it here! We go every time we are in the city! (It is a perfect place for special occasions, like celebrating life!) The food is absolutely mouth watering and allows you to try food that very well otherwise wouldn't! The portions are small enough to allow you to enjoy every course! The service... well picture being treated like royalty! (My favorite!) even if the food weren't that great I would pay the same amount simply for the service! This last time we visited we had a tour of the kitchen and oh my god! Such a fun experience to see where the magic happens! It is a clean and quality controlled kitchen that makes it easy to understand why every course is not only delicious but has such a beautiful presentation! We cannot wait to go back!"
111,5.0 star rating,"We came here for our first visit a few weeks ago and the dinner was excellent. There are far too many reviews about this place, all saying the same thing. So I'm not going to parrot them. Yes they're all true the food is good the food preparation is good and the people are great.  So rather I'll just highlight a few particulars from our visit. Dinner was 3hrs 15mins long after drinking as much apple brandy as we could. We sat in a corner seat on the second tier facing the chalk board painting. We did't get the wine paring as we just wanted a Syrah to enjoy. Had some coffee at the end and all was good. One thing I forgot to look at, or maybe I didn't notice it for a reason, was the old kitchen step. Maybe next time.... good times."
112,4.0 star rating,"TLDR: worth checking out for the experience, but have had better food at a lower price point; creative dishes; excellent service; dining in luxuryHave never been to a three star Michelin restaurant before and with its recent renovation and #1 status on The World's 50 Best Restaurants in 2017, Eleven Madison Park seemed like the right pick. Despite its steep price point (~$350 per person for the tasting menu, inclusive of tax and tip), reservations are difficult to come by, so a friend and I planned about a month and a half in advance. Reservations through Tock open up the first of every month at 9am ET for reservations during the subsequent month. We secured a 9pm reservation on a Friday through the help of the American Express Concierge.On the night of our reservation, we were warmly greeted by the hostesses and had our coats checked. The main dining room was bright and elegant, with high ceilings, large windows, crown moulding, modern chandeliers, and white table cloth tables. The bar area was a bit more intimate, with dim lighting, a fully-stocked back-lit bar, and large lounge chairs.Service was impeccable, where everyone addressed you by your name, took extra precaution around allergies, and generally made you feel like royalty. Our meal lasted about four hours, and we decided to order a bottle of red wine to pair with our tasting menu. Luckily, they gave us a tin with a paper accordion listing everything we ate (listed below with commentary). I can't remember when it was served, but there was also a bread course with salted butter. The bread was soft, warm, buttery, and generally amazing--we enjoyed it so much we got two servings of it. We were also given a tin of granola to take home.  1. Black and white cookie with cheddar and apple - small savory bites; kind of reminded me of fancy cheez-its in regards to taste2. Asparagus with smoked egg salad, daikon with ramps and pike roe, quail egg with radish and mustard greens, and spring peas with trout roe and lemon - served on wooden hexagons; light and refreshing3. Cheesecake with smoked sturgeon, caviar, everything bagel, and white asparagus - similar in texture to a traditional cheesecake, but savory4. Fluke marinated with daikon and sorrel - light and refreshing, similar to ceviche5. Lobster butter-poached with ginger and dandelion greens - one of my favorite courses; lobster was perfectly cooked and flavorful6. Snails grilled with morels and ramps - the presentation of this was really entertaining, as the snails were on kebab sticks and cooked at the table in a large fire; flavorful combination of snails and mushrooms7. Lamb with fava bean relish and nepitella - this was a bit of a disappointment, as the lamb tasted overcooked / old; the other option was duck, which my friend got--I tried a bite of that and it was pretty good8. Mustard greens with garlic and horseradish and snow peas with goat cheese and lemon - tasty accompaniments to our main courses 9. Goat cheese variations with rhubarb chutney - I didn't particularly like this course, as it wasn't quite sweet enough to feel like a dessert and the texture was a bit mushy10. Chocolate with milk ice cream and shortbread - rich and sweet; the chocolate was balanced out well by the milk ice cream11. Chocolate covered pretzel served with apple brandy - tasted like any other chocolate covered pretzel; the apple brandy was strong and aromatic; an entire bottle was served to us and we were told we could have as much as we liked (we both only had one serving though)While the food was good, I would hesitate to say it was worth $350. However, I'd recommend going once for a special occasion based on the overall experience."
113,1.0 star rating,"Sadly far from world number 1. The only restaurant on the list that I have been to that I rate lower is Relae. Disappointing. Lovely venue and service, the menu and flavour however completely lacking. Complacency at it's best. On a service note, it was impeccable and the venue lovely, just a pity the food was severely lacking. The kitchen tour was a nice touch."
114,5.0 star rating,"This is a review from when I had the opportunity to dine here a few years ago. It's an experience I think that changed the way I thought about food and blew my mind for how absolutely amazing food can be. While food is of course very important, the service was so perfect. To this day I have never eaten at a restaurant that matched their level of service.Eating at Emp showed me how truly delicious food could be. I've eaten out a lot and I've worked at Michelin starred resteraunts but something changed in me after this dining experience. Certain courses nearly brought tears to my eyes from how amazing it was.What amazes me is how much they are constantly changing the menu. A lot of high end resteraunts just recycle the same dishes over and over again. I've heard some people not enjoy it as much but maybe the menu didn't match with them at this time. I think everyone should experience this level of perfection at least once in their lifetime."
115,3.0 star rating,"The atmosphere, location, and service were exactly everything I expected from this restaurant and kitchen! But if I am being bluntly honest besides the service and hospitality provided. The food was, I hate to say it but DISAPPOINTING.. don't get me wrong I understand the courses were simple and elegant and I enjoyed it but the flavor profiles and textures just didn't come through for me and my husband. They're were some outstanding things but very few. Wasn't worth the money. If I knew what we were getting we would have just gone to Chicago and dined at GRACE again if it hadn't closed due to the management issues. Sorry Chef Daniel Humm. But we just weren't pleased with the food.."
116,5.0 star rating,"A somewhat belated review of a truly memorable lunch experience in March.  This restaurant has been on my bucket list for a while, but every time I came to New York, I couldn't manage to get a table.  When I knew I would be coming for a conference, I booked a table for lunch, the only time available for my dates, months in advance.  I started calling all my NYC crew but no one was available to join me.  I cast my net further afield to Philly and Boston and one of my Boston friends answered the gastronomic call.  He had to take a bus and come in just for the day, but proclaimed it totally worth it.With three Michelin stars, and the title of the ""Best Restaurant in the World"", there was a lot of expectation going in to the Sunday lunch... On arrival, we were ushered into a cathedral-like space with soaring ceilings and an austere but welcoming Art Deco décor, mostly whites with touches of blue, including a truly spectacular large abstract painting on the far wall.  Seated in a cozy corner banquet, we were greeted like we were a combination of royalty and long lost friends by our servers.  The cocktail menu had several unusual combinations, I opted for one containing gin and horseradish among several other things.  After a few sips, I actually felt sad, as I knew I would never have another cocktail as good as this one.  It was everything I ever wanted in a cocktail and more.  The cocktail by which all other cocktails will be forever judged and found wanting.  On the pristine white tablecloth, there was an intriguing white box tied with string.  I assumed it would a parting gift to be taken home, but yay! we were allowed to open it right away.  Inside were two small savory black and white cheese cookies.  A delightful bite to kick off the meal. Our first course was the scallop, which was served raw with sea urchin.  Delightful and fresh.  The next dish was incredibly intricate and really showed off the subtle skills of the chef, the caviar with smoked ham and hollandaise, a sort of deconstructed eggs benedict.  There was a lot going on with this dish but it all came together in a very sophisticated way.  There were multiple other courses, which I could go on about for great length, but one does run out of superlatives after a while. I do need to note the mushroom tart which was another beautifully presented and complex dish, and the duck, glazed with honey and lavender.  We were offered a choice of three desserts, and each chose one, but then they brought us one of each so we got to try them all. Last on offer was a chocolate covered pretzel, brought with a bottle of apple brandy.  We were invited to have as much brandy as we wanted.  Alas, after that cocktail (did I mention the cocktails are really good?) and a few excellent wines by the glass, we only managed a few sips of the brandy, with having to navigate LaGuardia airport in just a few short hours.  And there was a parting gift!  A glass container of granola to have for breakfast the following morning (which I did, and it was amazing).Did it live up to the hype?  Definitely.  Was it the best meal I have ever had?  Certainly I would say this was the most flawless meal in terms of presentation, quality and service I have experienced.  Literally I cannot find anything to nit pick.  The bathrooms were a little boring maybe?  I would rate this as one of the top five dining experiences ever and it will certainly always be a memorable meal.  I can't wait to come back for dinner.  Bring on the apple brandy."
117,4.0 star rating,"Had our anniversary dinner at EMP last night. It was a great experience overall. Service, ambiance, and the presentation of food were all wonderful. My favorite was the cheesecake caviar, and the signature duck dish was great too. The lobster was too hard to chew and white asparagus was used too much in the dishes - overall some of the dishes were too sour for my taste. Not sure if  it's because I'm spoiled by all the good restaurants in the city, the meal was great but I wouldn't say it's No. 1 in the world. I'd still recommend this restaurant as a Michelin 3-star experience tho."
118,5.0 star rating,"This review is pretty delayed, but that doesn't change the accuracy.  We had our best (EVER) dining experience at Eleven Madison Park.  We had reservations for dinner the day after our wedding and as soon as we stepped inside everyone congratulated us on our marriage and we were presented with a hand painted note that we still have on display at our home. Dining here is an EXPERIENCE.  The way that each course is presented makes dinner an adventure.  The food is delicious and the breakfast granola that they send you home with is also very tasty.  We plan to come back soon.  We've been to similar restaurants, and while they were excellent, none can compare to Eleven Madison Park."
119,2.0 star rating,"I dined here with a friend and we both found it to be pretentious and overpriced. The waiter refused to give us tableware that wasn't appropriate with the meal course. He also insisted we order off each section of the menu because that's the way the chef designed it. As for the food, if radishes dipped in unsalted butter is the type of thing that earns a chef a Michelin Star, this world has lost all hope. Two stars for a good gnocchi dish though. Everything else was totally unremarkable and in some cases downright not good."
120,3.0 star rating,"I didn't love it here as much as I wanted to. Some of the plates were really spectacular while others were just okay. The service was absolutely amazing. The desserts were great. Baked Alaska was delicious. At the end you play a chocolate game where you match the milk (goat, cow, etc) used to each chocolate which was fun! They give you their granola at the end to go. This was probably my favorite food of the night. I wished I had loved every plate, but alas."
121,5.0 star rating,There's a reason why EMP was rated the number one restaurant in the world. Everything from the bread to the duck to the service was impeccable.  The attention to detail is unreal. I went for my birthday and every single staff member stopped by our table to wish me a happy birthday.
122,4.0 star rating,"Went on a Saturday for a 9:45pm reservation. The atmosphere is very clean, elegant, and inviting since the revamp - nothing over the top which I like. The whole meal took about 3 hours.Food:I had their spring menu, which they said had a ""green"" theme throughout all the courses. Unfortunately for me this meant a lot of peas, which I'm not really a fan of (of course can't knock them for this).The wild braised duck was my favorite course and truly stood out - I thought it was one of the best ducks I've ever had. The cheesecake with everything bagel crust and caviar on top, the lobster course, and the grilled snails were the three other courses that stood out to me. Other than that, everything was very good but nothing mind blowing / anything to rave about.Alcohol:During the dinner I had two of their special whiskey cocktails with edelflower, which was super delicious ! Also had their tableside Manhattan (ordered with a hint of smokey mezcal) which was good/solid.During the dessert, they give you a full bottle of this apple brandy and you can have as much as you want - the alcohol wasn't very tasty but a nice concept.Overall:It's worth going, but for the #1 restaurant in the world, can't help but felt my experience fell short of that lofty title. The food as a whole was excellent but nothing spectacular compared to some other comparable Michelin star restaurants I've been to. If I go back, I would order a la carte at the bar and pick a few courses I like (and of course - have their absolutely delicious cocktails)."
123,5.0 star rating,"We celebrated our anniversary here, an incredible experience only equalled by Noma (Denmark). Definitely the best restaurant in New York I have been to. An experience for a special occasion, definitely worth the money..."
124,3.0 star rating,"The reputation of Eleven Madison created such a level of anticipation that my husband and I saved it for a special occasion. There were many servers in attendance refilling glasses and serving delicious breads. But while there was an inventiveness and a daring throughout the many courses the results were often salty and not memorably delicious.  The introduction of greens, particularly peas and snap peas, were a helpful to contrast but insufficient to refresh the pallet. The duck breast, for example, was perfectly cooked but had an overly salty crust. The seared pate was perfect but the terrine version clashed with an underlying berry layer.  All the plate presentations were minimalist and spare - modern in feel but just missing remarkable taste. Unlike the usual desert array in many such tasting menus, here there was no ""photo finish"" with a variety of pastries, cookies or chocolates. After a strange cheese chutney mouse course a simple dish of ice cream and berries or chocolate coating was set down.  Overall tremendous effort but an uneven menu not on the level of a three star in the US or abroad."
125,5.0 star rating,"The most unique food experience. The food was excellent and so was the service. Service was impeccable, warm and friendly.  All the food and servings were explained in detail making it even more enjoyable.  We had the wonderful opportunity to take a tour of the kitchen after enjoying our meal . It was also an amazing experience.  I have had the opportunities to dine at other Michelian star restaurants but this was by far the best!"
126,5.0 star rating,"We went for our anniversary. I was a bit concerned at first after reading some of the recent reviews, but I must say my partner and I had a wonderful experience. The seared foie gras and duck were spectacular, as were the cocktails we had!I had very high expectations walking into this restaurant given the number of accolades Eleven Madison Park has received, but overall, I had a spectacular experience here."
127,5.0 star rating,Eleven Madison is a true culinary experience!It was my husband's birthday dinner two years ago. I should admit this is a delayed review. What a mind blowing feeling. It is truly worth the money! Made me realize what a Michelin Star reflects!
128,4.0 star rating,"The first time we went to EMP last year (shortly before renos) was a definite 100/100. Water glasses seemed to fill themselves, the service was so beyond amazing that it felt they were one step ahead of you. The food was inventive and an experience.  We went back this time with a bigger group, and we felt it wasn't as good, warm and personable. We witnessed the wait staff drop china on the floor and another dropped a whole truffle on the floor after they finished  shaving it :o Also they gave me the granola I commented that they were so good last time giving me a nut free granola due to allergies. Luckily he overheard me and changed mine. At the end of the day it was still very good and some dishes were outstanding, and I guess since the benchmark that I'm comparing it to is EMP itself, it's a good sign."
129,3.0 star rating,"We had a lovely time. Staff was beyond friendly (although we did feel no one was over 23-27 years old working there, and wondered why), service was pretty attentive, sleek decor, and an overall lovely evening (still a very nice memorable celebration).  But I do not put this restaurant at the #1 in the world slot. And don't get how they have 3 Michelin stars. One thing that I hated was that it felt like a culinary school at all times with the kitchen making almost the exact same thing for every single table. You had a couple of options to choose from on the fixed menu told to you verbally, but it still felt like a school to me (us). When we went to Brooklyn Fare ages ago for their then 24 course tasting with all 18 guests, it felt like a private dinner party where they thoughtfully created colorful, visual dishes and tastebud masterpieces. But here to be in a large restaurant with everyone basically having the same thing here, it lost something with it and it felt redundant like a school. The food was good, but I (we) didn't feel it surprised or blew us away. We didn't sense real creativity to it to warrant the level they claim to be. Mind you, we hate foams and too creative over the top annoying dishes, but we felt it lacked elegant upscale creative culinary expertise. We wished for mind blowing wow factors as each course came out, but never got it. Again, it was very nice, but just didn't blow us away. We've had very simple that's blown us away, and we never saw that during this meal either. Le Bernardin is definitely still our favorite, and we are happy we dined here again since the reno, but I don't think we'd come back.We were very happy to have the kitchen tour, but we watched them escort in almost every table. Again, felt like a school."
130,4.0 star rating,"Servers and hosts were amazing and personable. But I'm not sure the food was worthy of being considered the best restaurant in the world. It wasn't bad by any means, it was still great. But none of the dishes made me feel like I had not had anything like that before. My wife and I both felt like some of the dishes were just slightly too salty, but this is just our tastes. The duck was my favorite dish and was fantastic. Perfectly crusted. The cocktails were also spot on. We still have a lovely experience though. And I may have just set my expectations unreasonably high (being called the world's best restaurant is a blessing and a curse)."
131,5.0 star rating,Pretty expensive but how delicious! This place delivers everything you expect from an ultra fine dining restaurant. Service and all service team are the best. This kind of restaurant I come to experience a new flavors and textures. Two thumbs up!

133,5.0 star rating,"I am a huge fan of Chef Daniel Humm and has visited his restaurant twice before, both times sitting in the main dining room. The meal was creative, exciting and delicious. The entire experience made for fun evening outs. This time, however,y sister was in town and wanted to go - but we hadn't made the much-needed far in advance reservations. We showed up around 7:30p (they open at 5p) and we were able to grab two seats at the bar! The menu is an abbreviated tasting menu (I believe 5 courses but they added things here and there so felt almost like 7) and it was perfect. The bartender was amazing - paired great wine and drinks with each course, friendly and fun. It was such a relaxed yet exquisite meal. I highly recommend if you don't have reservations and are willing to roll the dice - try eating at the bar! If not - there are great restaurants in the neighbor to substitute with..."
134,5.0 star rating,"A truly special experience and one of the best dinners of my life.  The evening was lovely.  The wait staff knowledgable, attentive, not over-bearing.  One of the people in our party was late - no problem for the restaurant.  We all came from busy, hectic days but we were transported to calm, peace, beauty and deliciousness within minutes of arriving.I have food allergies that were seamlessly attended to without missing an ounce of flavor or beauty in presentation. So many special touches throughout the evening... FABULOUS!"
135,4.0 star rating,"Great Michelin 3-star restaurant. My family and I loved the caviar ham benedict. It was the perfect combination. The duck and venison were cooked to perfection. The service was good, but not great as other 3-star Michelin's in NYC. Some dishes weren't being introduced to us. We had to actually ask the server about a certain dish. Other than that, the overall experience is great!"
136,5.0 star rating,"What a fun experience! We came here for our anniversary. They make each course an experience with their creative presentation and the food was delicious!! The service was impeccable. Definitely, top of my list for restaurant experience!!"
137,5.0 star rating,"Had the bar menu and it was exquisite.  Hubby doesn't like caviar so he took the vegetarian substitution for their signature eggs benny dish (cauliflower and black truffle). Very good as well. Other highlights include Szechuan peppercorn crusted duck, foie with squash purée and pumpkin seeds, and a savory dessert course of baked cheese and truffle. The squid was interesting but I did take quite a few bites of hubby's foie dish."
138,5.0 star rating,"Eleven Madison Park is one of the strongest pillars of New York City dining, boasting a remarkable tasting menu along with an extensive list of impressive wine choices. This is not just a fancy meal, it's an experience that everyone should have for themselves. Eleven Madison Park is certainly worth a special journey."
139,2.0 star rating,"We came here on probably one of the coldest nights of the year (12/30). We had extremely high expectations, as we've dined in other 3 Michelin Star restaurants that blew us away. EMP was just okay. We were sat by the door and had a chill the entire night. Every time the door opened a cold gust of air would blow in. Not only were we cold, but our food got cold extremely fast. If we didn't eat the course quickly, the food was cold. Not what I would expect from the supposed best restaurant in the world. Don't think it was worth the hype or the price. If you're looking for an unbelievable experience at a 3 Michelin Star restaurant, try Per Se."
140,5.0 star rating,"Contemporary American restaurant. Favorite dish is definitely the caviar ham Benedict. The flavor and presentation was memorable. Great services from beginning to end. There are probably more people working than people eating in the restaurant. Lol. Not the most expensive Michelin three star in NYC, but the experience was great. Complimentary bottle of granola at the end, and even a tour of the kitchen! For the interior, love the super high ceiling and huge window. The view was beautiful. Really enjoyed the dinning experience overall."
141,5.0 star rating,"We went here for lunch.  It was an unique dining experience, lasted for almost two hours.  All food items were very elegant and beautifully plated.  Ambience, Service, Food-  everything that afternoon was excellent.  It is worth every penny we spent that day."
142,5.0 star rating,"Hands down best 3 star restaurant I've been to. The staff is excellent, very accommodating, and most of all friendly. Even though this is a French fine-dining establishment, it doesn't have the certain air of coldness many restaurant staff present as part of the aesthetic. The tasting menu was spectacular and just the right amount of food/spacing between proportions. Everything was perfect to the last detail; I haven't had a better dining experience anywhere else. Note: I highly recommend checking out their summer pop-up location in the Hampton's when it opens, was there last year and has the exact same standard of food in an à la carts, casual setting."
143,5.0 star rating,"I went here for a lunch service prior to the reno and loved my experience. The staff were very attentive and down to earth. I liked that they explained some history behind a few of the  courses and even did some tableside cooking, but they did it in a very tactful way and not for every course so it wasn't overdone.There will be some classic signature EMP dishes that every foodie will recognize (miniature eggs benedict in a caviar tin, honey lavender glazed duck, vegetable steamed in a pig's bladder). Those dishes may not dazzling, but they're fun and part of the performance of the meal.The jar of granola they send you home with is just as delicious as they say.I definitely would look forward to coming back and hopefully get a booking for the dinner service this time."
144,4.0 star rating,"1 to 10FOOD : 7.5 Simple and nice, for my taste. Fav thing: Benedict with Smoked Ham, Sturgeon, and Hollandaise. Nice plating, the food was placed  in a caviar box.SERVICE: 7, overall it was okay, very dry. Just one thing: together with the cheese course, the restaurant should be ready to serve some bread, if the guest wishes so. They made me wait for so long for a piece of bread ( clearly they had to defrost it).AMBIENCE: 6, I'm not a big fan of Art Deco....and after the renovation I was so excited to see the changes! NOISE LEVEL : 9 ATTIRE: 8 Casual, the night I went, I was overdressed, some people were wearing t-shirts...."
145,5.0 star rating,Gorgeous creations. Delightful appetizers. Gracious servers. Well blended bib lettuce salad. Very exotic blend in egg quinoa kale dish. Perfectly done fish. Lovely place.
146,2.0 star rating,"Dined at EMP in December 2017 and I have to say it was NOT deserving of either a 3 Star Michelin or a top spot on Worlds Best Restaurant. Service: ordered a non alcoholic drink, the ones with the foam on top and they brought it out without a straw. They forgot. Had to ask them for one. Also, water glass was empty for a few minutes before being refilled. Other than those two slips in service, it was fine.Dishes: Nothing stood out. The unwrapping of the first dish was a nice touch to start the evening but afterwards I wasn't really blown away or even impressed with the rest of the courses. The foi gras - ehh, the duck breast - I've had better. The lobster was flavorful and my favorite course -- but come on, this is a 3 Star Michelin, every course needs to be on par. I've dined At Per Se, Atera, and Blanca and I would put Per Se and Atera above this by a long shot. Maybe it was just this one visit, but I just don't see the hype."
147,5.0 star rating,From beginning to end it was worth every single star. Our host Susanne made the evening even better.
148,3.0 star rating,"I had such high hopes for this restaurant. My experience with the bartender Matthew was perfection as he combined ingredients to find the perfect balance of flavors in the Parsnip with horseradish cocktail. Our anticipation and excitement peaked as we where seated . We have eaten at Alai'n Ducasse's restaurant frequently in Paris and were so excited to be here. As the plates began to appear and we tasted I became a little disappointed with the pairings of flavors . Maybe I'm just not into cheese... Some of the flavors were so overwhelming to me that they became ""the star"" instead of the protein . The plating seemed unimaginative.. For the best in the world I expected more."
149,5.0 star rating,I have chosen this restaurant for the special occasion. The ambience was welcoming and classy. The restaurant reminded me old aristocratic England. Dishes were petite but delicious. We indulged the chef's special tasting menu. Though the dessert didn't satisfy my palates.
150,4.0 star rating,"Food 4 starsHad higher expectations on it,despite many friend inform the food is average,duck meat is a must have.Service 5 starsExceptional customer service and tentative staff,kitchen tour was awesome Overall a great dining experience"
151,4.0 star rating,"Had the tasting 5 course tasting menu.   It was elegant and a fun culinary ride.  I particularly enjoyed the foie gras and caviar moments.  The final dish was a bit underwhelming but overall an enjoyable night.  We had 2 glasses of red, 2 glasses of Kir Royale, and 2 glasses of complimentary  dessert wine.  Excellent service but the experience a bit fast for a tasting menu, I'm curious about the 11 course experience now."
152,5.0 star rating,"Went here because the gentlemen in charge of their beverage program received his Master Sommelier designation on the movie Somm. The wine pairings were impeccable as expected and the food was exceptionally creative. One of the courses was an actual picnic basket with house crafted sodas, remarkable. Beautiful space, great service, great wine and great food. This place should have Michelin stars, oh wait it did at the time, 3 of them to be exact,"
153,4.0 star rating,"So this restaurant is definitely up there in my top restaurants, but I would by no means call it #1. -The first bite was a cross between a miniature black and white cookie and a ritz cracker cheese sandwich- nothing special to be honest.-The scallop course next with live diver scallop and sea urchin was wonderful- so fresh and light with the uni not overpowering the dish at all. And it worked so well with the sparkling pinot from Burgundy. The bread and broth with scallop infused butter on the side was another meh for me.-The sparkling pinot also worked well with the next dish- the play on eggs benedict with sturgeon caviar. A solid dish highlighted by the smoked ham with the caviar for me- they also provided miniature buns so you could create an egg mcmuffin sandwich of your own- very fun.-Then they invited me back to the kitchen- very similar to the French Laundry and such a nice touch. There they prepared another bite in front of me- chimney bread with black truffles done in a relish, cream, and a garnish. Again, a great touch, but it made me uncomfortable. When I eat something wonderful I like to eat slowly, chew thoughtfully and breathe a little, close my eyes, it's all very personal. And here I am standing at the station with people all around me and the server waiting to escort me back to my table, and honestly I couldn't really enjoy the dish. -Back at my table the next course was a definite wow for me- hudson valley foie gras with ginger, maple, and pickled apple paired with an amazing Cadillac (similar to a sauternes). I don't think I've ever taken as long to eat anything in my life, just couldn't bare to end it. The foie gras was perfect and the balance of the crisp pickled apple and the sweetness of the maple along with the Cadillac was just......I will be dreaming about this dish for quite awhile.-The butter-poached lobster was next and honestly the whole dish fell flat for me. I couldn't get past how chewy the lobster was for one, and the butternut squash and chestnut and kale just didn't add any warmth to me- they really didn't add much at all, though the sauce that was plated with it was delicious. Also, I'm not a big fan of Chablis to begin with and it was too bright and metallic for the dish I thought.-The mushroom tart was a table-side presentation and beautifully done- not to mention all the black truffle they shave over the crisp top. Over the top? Perhaps, but I loved it as someone who will never tire of all the truffle! In general though, I love mushrooms and this very pure mushroom dish was another highlight for me. I was excited about the Cabernet Franc from the Loire region as well (also as someone who loves Virginia/Maryland Cab Franc). It was definitely WAY more tannic than I was expecting and not something I could drink alone, but it did pair wonderfully with mushrooms and really brought out the funk in a good way.-The duck dish was...disappointing, but not because of the flavors. I love dry-aging and the peppercorn and lavender crust was mindblowingly good. But. When the dish came out the first time, the duck was a bit well-done for my liking and after I had talked to my server about the lobster, they told me to please let them know if I wanted anything done differently, and they were very sweet about it. So I had them take it back and the duck that came back out was seared on top but raw the rest of the way- which was perfect for the thinner end of the cut. But once I got up to the thickest part, I honestly had to cut away some of the uncooked part because it was just too raw for me and I felt really bad having them take it back a second time. It was honestly a little frustrating to know just how amazing this dish would have been if the duck was cooked properly throughout- maybe not have such a variation of thickness within the cut to keep from the inconsistent cooking? Overlooking that, the potato and the leek dumplings were good and the 2005 Nebbiolo from Piedmont was perfect with this dish. I've never had a more divine-smelling wine too, just smelling the beautiful mix of earthy cherry and floral (lavender?) easily passed the time while I was waiting for the duck .-It was fun to get a completely different preparation of a Nebbiolo from 2016 to compare with the last glass for the cheese course. The alpine cheese with celery root was wonderful and worked so well with this sweeter, more acidic Nebbiolo. The winter greens tossed in a black truffle dressing were a throw away for sure though and added nothing to the dish.-Another oh wow was the pumpkin cake with bruleed butternut squash, butternut squash and yuzu ice cream with sarsaparilla. Such an amazing blend of gentle sweetness, salty and savory and then the acid of the yuzu just cuts it so well. The sweet Ramandolo complimented every bite, especially since the dessert itself was not very sweet to begin with. Another really slow eat as I hated to finish the dish.AND Yelp apparently has a character limit"
154,5.0 star rating,"Excellent service - despite our large party - and beautiful venue. Interesting and delicious appetizers - carrot pate was a delicious surprise. I was surprised and pleased at the attention - and memory - regarding allergies. The staff was polite in reminding guests of ingredients and remembering preferences. The filet was a bit undercooked for my tastes - and while I'm certain they would've taken it back, with our large party I chose not to. I did enjoy the portion I ate - flavorful and moist. The beets and beet chips were a delectable accompaniment. One of my colleagues enjoyed a unique and delightful vegetarian option."
155,2.0 star rating,toooooo salty. Came here with friends for my bday non of us liked it and too expensive as well go to Le Bernadine instead
156,4.0 star rating,"I really want to do justice to this amazing experience - I will attempt to remember and describe all dishes in great detail -- Thanks to my husband for planning this once in a life time experience!Why 4 Stars?   Food just simply wasn't as good as other top tier restaurants such as French Laundry, Alinea, and even Chez Panisse.  For $300+ per lunch (without drinks), you expect some mind-blowing taste!I think it was a total of 12 courses?First came out some little savory cheese cookies and a delicious scallop broth.   The broth was actually one of our favorite items!  Very flavorful.  Perfect salt level.  Cookies were okay, but I didn't eat them to save room for the main event.  Scallop with sea urchin - delicious.  We enjoyed this light and refreshing dish.  I think there were some thin apple slices in it?  It was an appropriate appetizer.  Caviar - this is a take on Eggs Benedict with ham gelée, hollandaise custard, and sturgeon caviar.  Oh and a poached egg.  Very good.  Nothing particularly special except the container is beautiful.  Squid - this was good...   again, something you'd have at any good sushi restaurant.  Chopped up squid and horseradish and juniper.   We enjoyed it.  Foie gras - delicious.   simple sear.   But we were already starting to feel like the foods were too rich.  I didn't finish this item because I knew I couldn't get through the rest of the courses.  Lobster - good.  A few classic bites that are butter poached.  Halibut - I thought this was better than the lobster!   The cabbage on the side was awesome, warming, and perfectly seasoned.  The turnip on top was very flavorful and perfectly shaped like little fish scales.  Mushroom Tart - delicious broth and i loved the mushrooms!   But at this point, we're getting full and even though they put probably $400 worth of truffles on our food it's like...  what's the point?  They tasted earthy but that's about it.  Just some dry truffle shavings on a cracker...  didn't do it for me.    Venison - this is a take on a Beef Wellington and again while good, nothing to write home about.  More foie gras.  Actually getting tired of foie gras and truffles at this point.  How is that even possible?Duck with Cabbage -  this is actually featured in the Eleven cookbook - it's a beauty with lavender and Szechuan peppercorns on top.  They went a bit too far with the dry-roasted seasonings on top I think.   I don't really want to be biting through whole peppercorns and such but it does look nice.  Is it the best duck I've ever had?  No.  Trip to the kitchen -  so apparently if you ask you can visit the kitchen and see the amazing working they do back there...  plus they make you a great bite with (more) black truffle made into a mousse and piped into a cornet.  Kind of like the cone that they have at French Laundry.  I guess this is an homage to that.  It's okay but I didn't bother finishing it.  Too full and the black truffles were not flavorful no offense.  Tubby cheese -  at this point we're sick of eating, so I don't even remember this.  I think it was good.  It came with a mediocre dressed salad.  Chocolate Tuile with Creme Fraiche ice cream - good.  Don't know what else to say.  Pear Cranberry Donut with Mulled Wine Ice cream - okay so this donut is AWFUL.  I don't know who came up with this weird sour donut but it's gross.  but, the ice cream on the side is delicious!  I don't even like or eat dessert and I could bathe in this stuff man!Apple Brandy and pretzel chocolates -  oh so they bring you a whole bottle of brandy at the end and you can stay and drink as much as you like...  I did my part and had two shots!Overall...  not the best restaurant in the world in terms of taste or ambiance.  Service is great!  But for the money I think next time I'd rather do a Le Bernadin, or Per Se.  It was a fun experience but was it worth $700 for two people?...   ehhhh"
157,4.0 star rating,"Dinner was great, but a bit lackluster for the price, when compared to our other favorite restaurant Le Bernardin. What we enjoyed:*""Eggs Benedict"" caviar-- this dish got us so excited and probably raised our expectations too high*Honey- and lavender-glazed Duck with celery root was the most memorable dish for me (bf didn't seem to agree). Even the chef says this is probably the only recipe he feels he has perfected fully.Another excitement came from watching our wine bottle opened with port tongs!!The rest of the meal was still great but just not as memorable...Service was excellent!!"
158,3.0 star rating,"Maybe it was the hype of going to the # 1 rated restaurant in the world, maybe it was the fact that we've been waiting for this night for a while, but our expectations were not met, in fact, they weren't even close. The service was great as you would expect from such a place and the presentation of the food was top notch. Each dish was like a piece of art. So three stars for that. But each dish was super salty. By the time the main course came around, I couldn't even take more than 2 bites. They offered to have it packed but there was no way I was going to eat that when I got home. The wine pairing was sub par. Half of the wines were too sweet and the other half were just ok. There was not one drink that made me truly happy. If you decide to go to EMP, skip the wine pairing and order your own bottle or glass to go with your meal.All in all, it was an experience but for the money, you can get a much better experience (or two) elsewhere."
159,5.0 star rating,"I visited this restaurant with a friend (VF) the last time I was in the city.  We had an excellent tasting menu with wine pairing.  This was the first tasting menu that my friend had ever tried and she really enjoyed the experience.  Everyone was very helpful and attentive.  I noticed that some reviewers had some problems, but we did not experience any problems.  The food was comparable to other Michelin star restaurants that I have visited and the overall experience was great.My only (minor) problem was that the presentation of some of the courses could have been better.  A mostly white course on a white plate does not bring out the best presentation.  In other restaurants, they either highlight with a sauce or use a plate of a contrasting color."
160,4.0 star rating,"I come here to celebrate my birthday. ""The Best Restaurant in the World"" So I don't expect that. For the reputation of this restaurant, I expected better. I think the reviewers at Michelin meant to give this restaurant 3-4 stars on Yelp, We experience that gap between dishes was too long and it happened not only once, but between several courses. If you plan on going here, make sure you have time, it took 3-4 hours. Completely missing the Wow factor you expect as far as food is concerned. The food was even a bit boring, and monochromatic. The presentation was outstanding as well as the taste. Overall, it was a wonderful experience. Service was exceptional, everyone was very friendly and from beginning to end. Was welcomed by a box of delicately packed savory cookies, and then 11 carefully selected courses.  It was good, just not great."
161,1.0 star rating,"If you plan on dining at the No.1 restaurant in the world please make reservations to the Hospital as well. The horrible food poising I got had me seeing ""the light"" at the hospital and who ever can help you see Jesus deserves a full review. If you plan on visiting this place; please increase the payout on your life insurance! (Your loved ones will thank you for it)I woke up the morning after dining at Chef Daniel Humm's place and the food poisoning set it. It was probably their undercooked meat or the disregard from the chef after I was very clear that I have a mushroom allergy, perhaps it was the undercooked potatoes in tacky tin foil!  I went to the Hospital and the doctor indicated what I already knew. Hallelujah for Pedialite because it was all I could keep down for 2 days (think of the exorcist scene) when I drank anything else). On the bright side of losing 4 days of work and having terrible diarreah for 5 days; I lost 7 lbs.If you want to live on the edge and experience the grim reaper destroy your stomach have at it! Some people live for near death experiences.Opt for Le Bernardin, Per Se or Daniel instead. Better service, better food."
162,5.0 star rating,"There are not enough words to describe EMP but to call them exemplary is just putting it mildly.  They live up to being the #1, (if not top 3) restaurants in the world.  Their customer service is amazing and the attention to detail is extraordinary.  EMP has been on our bucket list and it so happened that I was able to snag reservations around the holidays.  Coincidentally, we were expecting baby #2 thus when they sent me an email prior to our date inquiring if we were celebrating anything in particular I just mentioned it briefly.  Most of the reviews rave about their customer service and I wholeheartedly agree with them all but I think they definitely impressed us by surprising us with a cute baby onesie with their logo on it! I was completely floored and wanted to give our lovely hostess a big hug for their thoughtfulness and again, superb attention to detail!  You will NOT go hungry, we were definitely struggling to finish a little half way through the courses.  Although the portions are small, they all pack a punch and vary in savoriness.  I would also recommend trying their coffee presentations at the end.  You already dropped several hundred dollars, why not splurge another ~$40 or so to finish off with fancy coffee?"
163,5.0 star rating,"This is the best meal I've ever had in my life. Unlike the French Laundry, which felt so sterile and proper, my waiter at EMP joked around with me. The ability to participate in the dining experience, such as customizing and mixing your own carrot tartare, definitely set it apart from the rest. The apple brandy was unlimited and at the end of the meal, everyone got to take home a mason jar of delicious granola. All in all, deserving of all 3 michelin stars as well as the best restaurant in the world for 2017."
164,5.0 star rating,"EMP will forever be the GOAT of food and dining for me. I've been there 5 times and every visit has surpassed any expectations I have...I don't know how they do it, but it's always the best food, the best service, the coolest stories, and we usually get to do something fun on each visit. Once we got to visit the kitchen and saw all the cool words and phrases inspired by Miles Davis and run true for the restaurant- JAZZ, they've got a lot of it. Every visit feels different and unique and even the dishes flow with each season but still keep the integrity of the restaurant. It's a certain indescribable alchemy that happens in the kitchen and the stellar FOH operation that will always be GOAT in my mind."
165,1.0 star rating,"Well, what can I say... Michelin Guide is very misguided in their 3 star rating for this mess of what some call ""the worlds best restaurant"".   We've been to many fine dining places in the city, including Daniels, Jean Georges, Per Se, and Masa to name a few, so it was good feel the caliber of this place in comparison to their competitors.We had a reservation for 2 for dinner and arrived about 20 minutes early.  Upon entering, we were quickly approach by an uncomfortably high strung woman who's energy seemed a bit too invasive for a high class restaurant.Since we came a bit early, we were guided to a waiting area with 2 chairs right in the unsightly intersection of the hallway, bathrooms, coat check and second floor stairway, basically the busiest cross section of the place with groups of people constantly lining up with their rears toward you as they wait for their coats, bathroom, etc.  Totally uncomfortable, noisy, and hectic place to sit customers for the waiting area.  Once they finally realized the chaos we were placed in, someone came, apologized and took us to our table.  At this point, we were tense, uncomfortable and definitely not in a fine dining mood.As we were seated, we were given a wine list that is as thick as an encyclopedia, and a pleasant woman came to discuss the best wines for our taste, this went pretty well.While waiting for our wine, a careless waiter serving the table next to us knocked over a patrons' cell phone on the floor.When our waiter came, he told us the menu items and we had to choose right there what we wanted (we were never given a menu to look at), but had to choose on the spot while he stood there and mentioned their items.  This made everything seem rushed and pressured.  To add further, as soon as the waiter took our order, he tells us he will take our desert order later, creating further feelings of being rushed somewhere.At this point, we're happy to see our wine being poured so we can finally take a little breather from all this mess.   I won't get into minute detail, but the presentation of dishes was very lackluster (dark, grey, bland colors, no pizzaz), the flavors were overpowering each other  (e.g. truffle dish was overpowered by the hollandaise sauce it was mixed with, the caviar in another dish was overpowered by the smoked/salty fish cream).  By the way, these dishes were served in Tin Cans!, similar to the ones supermarket sardines would be placed in.  This is supposed to give a sense of freshness eh?   As I was eating the warm bread bun with butter over a small plate, one busgirl just pushes my plate aside from under me, mid-bite, and puts another dish in front of me.  I almost choked.Another absurd dish I was served was essentially a small piece of toasted rye bread with bitter tasting lettuce on top and some salad dressing type sauce.  At this point I'm realizing that the joke's on us.  You're kidding me with lettuce on toast right? It gets better... I am then served some kind of pancake looking dish that is elegantly called ""Beluga Lentils"", it's just beans compressed together with potatoes and garlic.  The main course, which was duck, was cooked OK, but the meat was chewy and bland.The only half decent dish was the mushroom tart with crimini and truffle mushrooms.We must have had 5 or 6 different busboys/girls come to our table throughout the night, most were trying to please, but unfortunately, this created a sense of constant distraction with so many different people coming and talking to you.  When the crumbs were being wiped from our table, some were spilled on me and hit my hand and pants.For desert, I had a pear-cranberry donut, that's right a freakin donut.  Although not bad tasting for a diner perhaps, this is not acceptable for such a restaurant.   Although we were not finished with desserts, our main waiter took it from our table without asking if we were finished, making us feel like he wanted us to leave quicker as this was already 12:20am.The decor inside is bland, boring, colorless, no flowers or any soul...  staff is also dressed in gray.  I thought these guys just renovated?   Anyway, we were completely blown away by the failures on all levels in this restaurant and totally didn't expect this from a 3 star michelin restaurant.  After doing some research on Michelin, we realized it's all a farce, see this Vanity Fair Review of Michelin's approach, it put everything into perspective for us:https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/11/whats-wrong-with-the-michelin-guideProbably this place would have more 1 star reviews if people didn't mind re-living their bad experiences and writing them here, but most probably avoid doing."
166,4.0 star rating,"Eleven Madison Park, led by Daniel Humm and Will Guidara, has created a masterfully elegant experience punctuated by unique offerings, knowledgeable teammates, and a classic and yet modern environment. A solid 4.5 stars. AMBIANCE (4/5)The restaurant, which I visited shortly before it received its #1 restaurant in the world recognition, offers a high-ceilinged, refined, large main space and spotlessly-run kitchen.FOOD (4.5/5)Across 14 courses, the dinner proved to be one-of-kind, delightful, and interesting. I left stuffed! While I unfortunately forgot to snap a picture of the menu, here are some of the courses I recall:- Black and white savory cookie- Caviar eggs Benedict, deconstructed, served in a cute tin- Sturgeon sabayon with chives, served in an eggshell- Picnic basket - Foie gras layered with cabbage (unique and yummy)- Waldorf salad, made tableside (delicious)- Honey and lavender roasted duck (surprisingly dry, which we mentioned when asked how the duck was - the team apologized but didn't offer a new duck or substitute dish)Missed out on the celery root baked in a pig's bladder this time - maybe another time! SERVICE (4.5/5)A friend who's an alum of 11Mad kindly secured us reservations on short notice so we didn't experience the frenzied reservation process. The team was highly professional, attentive, friendly, and discreet. When we asked for recommendations on local restaurants the staff likes, the team quietly conferred and came back with a printed card with their suggestion (Gabriel Kreuther which later served as a great birthday lunch). Our friend had arranged for a private tour of the kitchen, complete with snow cones on which to nibble throughout. Contrary to the chaos of reality TV cooking shows, I was amazed by how operationally efficient and quiet the kitchen was. The work's divvied up across different stations, with each person a master of his/her area. Thank you, Eleven Madison, for a very special special occasion!"
167,5.0 star rating,"Lives up to the expectations of a three star Michelin restaurant called the ""worlds best"" restaurants. Service is fantastic. Waitress went out of her way to explain the menu and accommodate any particular dietary needs.  Every server made sure water was always topped off and the entire group really embodied the definition of service with a smile. The food is an experience more than a meal. Every bite brings different tastes and reactions.  There were extremely high points in the meal from the fish (bass) to the amazing desserts.  The only dish we both didnt enjoy was the squid 2 ways which didnt work at all for either my wife or I.  Every other dish blended taste and presentation perfectly together.  Please see included pictures for almost every dish we had."
168,5.0 star rating,"Definitely lives up to its reputation as the best restaurant in the world! I took my boyfriend here to celebrate his birthday and everything was truly flawless! Everyone who waited on us (even the guy pouring water) wished him happy birthday. I can honestly say its one of the best dining experience I have ever had and well worth the price. Some takeaways:-The menu is a ""conversation"" (as in you don't receive a physical menu) which allowed us to discuss our food preferences and make some decisions about what the courses would look like. Everything we picked was absolutely delicious! -You will not leave hungry! While the portions are fairly small, the number of courses will fill you up. We actually couldn't eat the final chocolate pretzel course because we were so full. Anyone who tells you they left hungry is either lying or eats an abnormally large amount of food on a regular basis. -If you get up to go to the bathroom you may delay your upcoming course. They will not ""drop"" food if someone has walked away from the table. And if that delay causes the food to be less than perfect, you may be waiting for a while so that they can get the food back to perfection. -The entire experience took about three hours. Relax, enjoy the experience, and plan to be there for a while. -At the end of your meal you get a gift. Right now it's a caviar tin with your printed menu and golden raisin granola (which is outstanding!)"
169,4.0 star rating,"Very cerebral and interactive dining experience but I have honestly had better food. As expected, the decor was beautiful and the service was great but I was not super impressed with the flavors. We went during the summer so if we were to return, I would try going during the fall or winter for a different menu. Also- I wore white and one of the courses was like a deconstructed lobster boil and when we cracked one of the claws, red sauce splattered on my shirt lol. The staff was apologetic and brought over Shout wipes but like, really?"
170,2.0 star rating,Didn't live up to hype. Food was unusually salty and not that interesting. I've had better meals at fancy restaurants for a fraction of the price.  The service however was very good except for one snooty waiter.  They pre-charged my card $600+ extra for the wine pairing which I hadnt requested. Had to call them to have that charge taken off.  There are other much better three star michelin restaurants in the city.
171,3.0 star rating,Skip it. For the pre-fix edible artwork. Everything thing served was tepid and you leave hungry. Not worth it.
172,5.0 star rating,"Not really much I can add here, except that the food is phenomenal and the service is above and beyond. Highlights were the foie gras, when the ""dream waiter"" hand drew me an etiquette card after a related conversation with our server, and the kitchen tour. I also loved that there were no supplements, meaning every dish was included in the cost of the prix fixe. Also, the granola rules."
173,3.0 star rating,"I have been here 6 times and i only loved it once (the first time...there was a chicken dish and it was out of this world. For the first time, i truly appreciated the existence of chicken...besides eggs. Haha.) But everytime i come back subsequently, i keep getting disappointed. I find the foods were pretty forgettable and lacking in creativity. The flavor profiles were inconsistent and temperature was lukewarm at times for some dishes. Not sure i would come back anytime soon."
174,4.0 star rating,Great dining experience. Good service with a great eye for detail to every single dish. Must try!
175,3.0 star rating,"The food and presentation was excellent but I wouldn't say the best. I don't know how restaurants of this caliber can't understand how awkward it is to give one table all the attention for their special occasion and not give another the table anywhere near. It appeared the table next to us was celebrating a birthday and EMP pulled out all the stops while we were on a honeymoon which I would hope happens less often than a birthday does for people. Not one thing special was done for us. I have been here previously for a birthday and my boyfriend at the time was very excited to bring me and told them of the celebration and the same issue where we saw other being given the special treatment. Also this time was given the bill before finishing our champagne. At that, our third bottle. Made us feel like they wanted us to leave. Oh well, it was fine. Plenty of other places in the world to go. Alinea in Chicago far exceeds in terms of food and service."
176,5.0 star rating,"Amazing dining experience! The service was great and attentive for the most part. We really liked everything we had - especially the caviar, foie gras and halibut. Everything was really good and definitely live up to the 3 Michelin stars reputation. I'm not sure how this is necessary the number 1 Restaurant on the 50 world's Restaurant list, not saying they don't deserve it, but makes me wonder what's the criteria to make the determination. Having gone to Central, Maido, Alinea, Andre and Le Berdine on that list, it's not easy for me to tell how this is THE best. It would be good if we get a list of criteria from the 50 world's restaurant list in order to make the proper comparison. Nevertheless with that said, it was a wonderful dining experience. We traveled here from California, and it was worth the journey!"
177,1.0 star rating,"I have to say that I was quite disappointed with my experience at this ""3 Michelin Star"" restaurant. The place itself is beautiful. But, The food was ok and I was let down by the service. My sister and I went to celebrate her birthday and showed up on schedule for our reservation. We were seated at a table at the corner of the room, sitting at two corners facing the entire room. I know this may be a matter of preference but it was quite uncomfortable facing all the other diners sitting in the room. As we sat down, we noticed a bunch of wrapped gifts in the middle of the table. Then, we sat waiting....watching the waitstaff walking back and forth and watching the other diners eat. It may have only been a few minutes but, it felt awkwardly long before someone approached us to let us know that our first course was in the presents and they needed to be unwrapped. Quirky fun presentation but, just aggravating that we waited so long. Moving on, I am used to having either a set menu or ordering a la carte at a Michelin. The menu here consists of three courses and you chose from two options each course. Again, this may be preference but I felt pressured to pick the better one not knowing which one would be better. My sister and I ended up picking opposite items for each course in order to try everything. Each course was hit or miss but overall underwhelming. Again, I understand taste is a matter of preference so I will not go into details. So, I would like to elaborate on the service. The staff was courteous but pretty stiff, which made the experience feel pretentious. I've been to several Michelin restaurants in Europe and the U.S. and my experience has been that staff is usually genial and/or entertaining. They make you feel comfortable and welcome, which I didn't feel here. And, the mini donut with candle was a disappointing ""birthday"" surprise for my sister. To top it off, I ordered a small coffee at the end of my meal and I was presented with a check (since we ordered additional wine). No coffee until I had to ask about it. Overall, I'm not sure why Eleven Madison Park is ranked number one, toppling that lovely restaurant in Modena, Italy. This was a let down..."
178,5.0 star rating,"Came here to have lunch with my husband.Our nearly three hour lunch felt so short, and I have to say it was more like a combination of eating good food + watching a performance of how some of the courses were being plated. We had the eleven course retrospective menu, and I can't emphasize enough how perfect the whole experience was.I am not going to elaborate on each and one of the courses because it will literally be my repeating the same adjectives over and over again trying to describe how impressed I was. Pictures say more than the words so I have attached some photos. Presentation of each dish was very pretty, and the server explained about each course.. how and where they fit into the chronological timeline of EMP.I really enjoyed how they made the carrot tartare in front of each table,how they poured the sea water to our seafood dish to reproduce the atmosphere of where the ingredients came from, and many other presentations that kept us captivated.Food was excellent, dessert was excellent, service was excellent. We were full after the eleven courses but they serve you enough portion for each course so that you don't leave with uncomfortable feeling.I'm sure it's obvious but drinks, coffee, teas are extra (not part of $300). They give you the jar of granola to take home along with the menu of all the dishes that were served. Had great time."
179,4.0 star rating,"Lives up to its reputations and 3 stars.  The prices are a little high and I found the restaurant to be loud, but overall a very good dining experience. I'm not sure I'd rush back, but I would recommend to people to try once."
180,5.0 star rating,"This was an experience to remember. I remember that the interior of the restaurant was beautiful (the floral embellishments at the center, wanted to ask who the florist was, they were throwing a wedding after-party upstairs assumed to be reserved for special occasions with glass walls, so everyone seemed to be having a good time without the sound effects), the service was excellent, the courses were presented in a creative way, the tour of the kitchen made us feel special, how clean and organized the kitchen was, how this chef made us a cocktail mixed with liquid nitrogen. The night felt like a dream."
181,3.0 star rating,"The best restaurant in the world - according to San Pellegrino - fell short of the expectations one might have for a restaurant of its supposed caliber. As has been noted already, the food here was decent, but not great; simply done, but simple to a fault. The good: * The tasting menu is on the more ""affordable"" side of things at ~$300 - for a 3 Michelin starred restaurant in a large metropolitan city, that's a good deal * The truffle course & the caviar benedict course were good* The ambiance & decor of the restaurant were perfect - just the right combo of fancy / casualThe bad:* Unfortunately, most of the plates were ""just ok"" :-( For example, the dry aged duck was tough and overcooked; the greens dish was served on top of an unappetizing slice of ""rye custard,"" aka a cold, soggy piece of rye bread; the mulled wine ice cream had ice flakes in it (indicating that it was melted, and then frozen again). Etc. * Plating was not entirely impressive, which I imagine is partially due to simplicity of ingredientsI didn't walk out of the restaurant thinking that I had just eaten at the ""best restaurant in the world"", but I believe it's unfair to hold any restaurant to such an impossible (if not mythical) standard. Even so, the quality of 11MP was not quite there even by regular standards. I don't think I'll be back, but I'm glad I can cross this off my bucket list!"
182,4.0 star rating,"My best friend and I decided to go here since this place was rated the best restaurant in the world. It also has 3 Michelin stars. We were looking forward to eating here. The experience is pretty good however I don't think it was the best food or experience ever. My friend and I also went to Next restaurant in Chicago a few months ago and I have to say the food and experience was better. We've also been to Per se in New York before as well. And Eleven Madison Park is definitely Better so I thought a four star was fair for the experience. My favorite dish here was the scallop with sea urchin,scallop butter and broth. It was very super refreshing and I love the apple slices with it as well it really mixed well with the seafood. Another favorite was the Halibut poached with Variation of Turnip. Best Halibut ever! The caviar Benedict is pretty good too. However I have to say the rendition made by the Next chef was slightly better...The Mushroom Tart with Cremona and black truffle was pretty cool too. They do this fancy plating in front of you. The dessert is nothing special though. The dessert at Perse and Next restaurant is definitely better! So I would say overall not sure if it was worth the price but I am still glad I tried it once but would probably not go back."
183,5.0 star rating,"Young and fun--what a surprise.  It takes a nano second for someone to mention this place is #1 ranked in the the world this year and so they have everything to prove.  They pretty much did but the delight was how young-but-professional the staff is (one person over 40, rest younger), and how much fun.  We had a great/delicious kitchen tour, hob-knobbed with a non-pretentious sommelier, and they gave my wife (henceforth known as ""the camel"") a hand written award for most water ever consumed by a diner at one sitting.  The renovated Art Deco decor and consummate attention perhaps conceal an efficiency--relatively few dining options allow the kitchen great focus.  I did note tables unused for the duration of our meal and wonder if popularity is flagging.  We'll go back...soon."
184,5.0 star rating,"Eleven Madison Park was nothing short of magical. The price may be a pain point for some (especially if you're opting for the wine pairings), but when you're devouring course after course, the rest of the world comes to a complete halt, and nothing else matters. You sit there, a fork in one hand and a knife in the other, with an expression that can only be described as a stupid, dumbfounded grin. Because in that moment, you are not the you who strolls down Fifth Avenue with shopping bags in hand, or the you who takes trips to Europe to eat the best of what chefs around the world have to offer, or even the you who works tirelessly to scrape up enough disposable income to treat yourself to a night out here. In that moment, you are part of the EMP family, and you will unquestionably be treated as such from the second you step into their doors.To get some of the logistics out of the way, I came here on a Friday night at 6:15PM with my mom to celebrate her birthday. I called ahead of time to let the restaurant know the special occasion, in addition to my aversion to cheese. Along with the tasting menu, we opted for the wine pairings, along with a table-side brewing of the High Mountain Oolong tea at the end of the meal. In total, the food came out to $642 and change, and the beverages an additional $406.Overall, I just wanted to share my thoughts on a few different points:1. Wine PairingsWhile I enjoyed the wine pairings, if I were to return, I don't think I'd be getting it again. The wines were interesting, and they definitely paired well with the food that was presented, but ultimately, I don't think the varieties we were served justified the high cost. A vast majority of the wines were French - not really an issue, just something to keep in mind if you're not the biggest fan of wines that taste earthy and heavily reflect the terroir of where the grapes were grown.2. Prolonging the EMP ExperienceAt the conclusion of the meal, the restaurant gifted us a bag filled with a jar of house-made granola from that morning, along with a cleverly designed menu of all the courses we tasted that night. The menu itself is folded in the same tin can that the caviar course was presented in, and was a nice touch compared to the plain paper menus that were handed out in the past. In addition, for my mom's birthday, they also included a large chocolate bar in her bag that she has yet to taste.3. Table-side teaAt first, I didn't think the $24 price tag on a table-side experience would be worth whatever EMP had in store. Thankfully, I was proven wrong, and I actually learned a great deal about the restaurant's philosophies in brewing both tea and coffee, along with some of the science and art behind a great cup of brewed tea. The Gaiwan set they used looked and felt amazing in its pure simplicity, and the tea sommelier was kind enough to provide an extra steeping of the Oolong as well.4. FoodTo quickly touch on the courses we were served that night:* Black and White Cookie with Cheddar and Apple - B* Scallops with Sea Urchin, Scallop Butter, and Scallop Broth - A+* Caviar Eggs Benedict with Smoked Ham and Sturgeon - A+* Foie Gras marinated with Squash and Pumpkin Seeds - A+* Poached Halibut with Turnip - A* Mushroom Tart with Cremini and Black Truffle & Portobello - A+* Venison un Croute with Foie Gras and Civet - B* Roasted Carrot with Buckwheat and Mustard - B+* Baked Potato with Horseradish and Bacon - B+* (Instead of Grilled Cheese) Chocolate Tuile with Creme Fraiche Ice Cream and Cranberry - A-* Pear-Cranberry Donut with Mulled Wine Ice Cream - A* Chocolate Covered Pretzel & Apple Brandy - A-While EMP didn't wow us with an impeccable menu suited to our exact taste buds course after course, overall, we had a sublime evening. The granola they sent us home with is fantastic, and I'm still very happy about the fact that we got to bring home the tin can with the EMP insignia branded on the top - I actually considered just taking it during the caviar course but decided against it.Reservations may be difficult to come by and try for, and the price tag may be even more difficult to justify, but given the chance, I would do it all again in a heartbeat. Chef Daniel Humm has created not only a stunning, innovative menu that will pique your interests throughout the meal, but also an experience that you will cherish for years to come."
185,5.0 star rating,"A wonderful foodie experience! Highly recommended if you have the time, budget, and company. My wife and I enjoyed the tasting menu and wine pairings throughout the meal. Will post photos shortly...."
186,5.0 star rating,"I'm not sure what there is to say that's not already been said. Eleven Madison Park was a superb dining experience. There's a reason it's consistently showered with awards and placed on prestigious list after prestigious list. Things here are done so impeccably, so pristinely, it almost felt too composed. The amount of preparation that so clearly goes into every aspect of the EMP experience is truly remarkable. The menu, the service, the wine pairings--all choreographed and executed to perfection. I suppose one should expect this considering the price tag on a meal here. But you never really know until you try. And try, we did. My boyfriend--the best there is and ever was--got us a reservation here for my birthday. I'm a big-time foodie, but not the type you'll find at Michelin spots. I like to splurge when I dine out, but there's a line and places like the EMPs, Per Ses and Le Bernadines of the world are far beyond what I'm willing/able to pay. So this was just all kinds of special. Now, this point is important because I don't have any similar experiences to compare our night at EMP to. We've never done a long tasting menu before and we've only done a handful of prix fixe nights out. But I've had the pleasure of eating at a lot of really really good restaurants in NYC, so I'd like to think my two cents is still worth something. So we arrived here for our 8:45 reservation and walked into splendor. Coats were taken and we were delivered to our seats. We opted for the standard wine pairing, which is $175/pp. If you're going to drink and are a fan of wine, I think this is probably your best option. It's expensive, but the alcohol on the menu here is just wildly expensive--even the half-bottles (try to keep in mind that I'm a millennial with a modest salary who has a hobby that she really has no business trying to afford)--so the pairing made the most sense for us. And it was delicious. My boyfriend and I ordered different dishes when the option was available to try as many dishes as possible, which meant we got to sample a wonderful variety of wines as well. The only instance in which I'd recommend going with a bottle or half-bottle (or cocktails) is if you're a lightweight/aren't a huge drinker. I think the pairing amounts to about 4-5 glasses of wine, which might be a serious undertaking for some. That said, the meal does last 3+ hours so the alcohol intake is somewhat moderated. When I review restaurants, I tend to list the dishes we try and grade each one. We had a nine-course meal at EMP, so it would be hopeless (for the sheer reason that I'd run out of characters almost immediately, a roadblock I face virtually every time I write a review on here). I'll list what we received here but give some more general commentary/give little shoutouts to the highlights. All listed chronologically to give an idea of flow:*Apple / Cheddar Black and White Cookie: A+*Scallop Live with Sea Urchin, Scallop Butter and Broth: A+*Caviar Benedict with Smoked Ham, Sturgeon, and Hollandaise, served w/ mini English Muffins: A++Squid grilled w/ Juniper and Horseradish: A+Foie Gras Seared w/ Maple and Apple: A++Lobster butter-poached w/ Butternut Squash and Chestnut: A++Halibut poached w/ variations of Turnip: A*Mushroom Tarte w/ Crimini and Black Truffle: A++*Crimini and Portobello served w/ mains: AHoney and Lavender-glazed Duck w/ Cabbage: A+*Potato baked w/ Horseradish and Bacon: A*Leek w/ roasted Hazelnut and Parmesan: AVenison en Croute w/ Fois Gras and Civet: A+*Cheese tart: A+Pear Donut: A+Chocolate-covered Pretzels* = both receivedThe only real surprise with everything here was the presentation/aesthetics. Nothing was particularly colorful or fancy. Quite simple, superficially, far more complex when you take a bite. I don't know if that's intentional on EMP's part, but it was almost peculiar. That's hardly a gripe though, everything was just delicious and brought out at the perfect pace. The wine pairings were delightful, thoughtful and certainly enhanced the consumption experience. Highlights/notes:-The black and white cookie was as a mind-f*** and a tasty one at that-Everyone should wrap their uni in a live scallop blanket -Hard to get more decadent than caviar eggs benedict and my god, I have never tried to take a longer time eating something-You will never insult squid again by ordering it fried after having this squid preparation-I said that thing about decadence with the eggs benny but I maybe already changed my mind because that foie gras knocked me over-The best entertainment out there is watching someone shave truffle over something you're about to eat and then eating that something with pride-Duck can be big, ugly, messy and tasty or elegant, refined, clean and tasty. I love duck. Duck is tasty. This duck was as good as it gets. -I don't like donuts but I loved this donut. What else is new?-Gold pretzels. Mic drop."
187,4.0 star rating,Dinner pre fix menu is too expensive.  The food here is very delicious.  Only been here once and 50/50 would want to come back and try again.  The services here is 100% on par.  The drinks here is very good.  High quality food for high quality price.  I remember the butternut squash was very yummy.  The pate with warm baguette was yummy.  It's expensive!!! so save up your money.
188,3.0 star rating,"Maybe because it was the ""bar version"" but overall the meal was just ok. Granted the duck was incredible and so was the donut but the cost vs. what you get isn't the greatest. It is a very, very nice restaurant however. I probably wouldn't go again. For comparable prices I thought jean George and del posto were much better."
189,1.0 star rating,"Wow, what a night, I  left the restaurant shocked and amazed, not about how good they are of course, but  about How can that possibly be a Michelin 3 star restaurant!!? I literally took a day to process why Eleven Madison Park was named the Best Restaurant in the world for 2017. My conclusion is maybe that title put them at so much pressure that they have decided to go low key for this year's new tasting menu. I am just out of luck that I went in a few days too late for their previous tasting menu. My night was ruined after 3 long hours of bland unappetizing food.  I'm visiting from LA with my boyfriend and we already dined at Per Se,  Le Bernadine, Jean Georges, the river cafe, and a couple other Michelin restaurants before our dinner here at EMP, of course we had to stop here before going back to LA in a couple days. We are both huge foodies and dine out everyday, and we do know how to properly appreciate food. I tried so hard to love EMP, I really did, but I just can't:(  I rarely write reviews about restaurants on Yelp because I usually don't have too strong of a feeling towards them, So EMP really struck a nerve for me. I even called the manager at EMP Billy to help me understand why their new menu is the way it is. All I got was ""they do thrive for simplicity there so the food both taste good and really focuses on that ingredient alone. "" Nothing else. okay, this is where it all went wrong. There is nothing wrong with that concept except EMP FAILED at EVERY ASPECT OF THAT CONCEPT!!!!! Sure the dishes were simple, but it was visually unappetizing and tasted flavorless and uninteresting. I don't expect every dish to be plated beautifully like how most of the fine dining restaurants like to do, but I do expect every dish to taste delicious. I can't believe they could ruin foie gras and truffle for me. The seared foie gras tasted like pork fat, me and my boyfriend both agreed unanimously. The lobster was chewy, the venison was under seasoned and the foie gras wrapped in middle of it was unnecessary, the diced up squid was a joke, and it's pointless to go through and describe how every dish taste because they all fall under the same description: bland and unappetizing. The caviar dish was probably the only  dish that deserves a Michelin 3 star rating, and that dish was in previous tasting menus already. Service here was good, not really warm and welcome, just good. There was several times where we waited roughly 15 minutes for our dish to arrive, where we had nothing on the table and just sat there awkwardly sipping more and more wine.  There is also a no flash photography rule here:) all I wanted was a picture using my Polaroid. Not a flash photography of every dish. Sure is strict for a restaurant with no dress code. I am writing this to inform people do not come here at this time, maybe after they change their tasting menu again. Or else you will regret coming here and  be disappointed by ""The Best Restaurant in the world"" I honestly don't think they will keep this title till next year. Or maybe do go just so you can say you dined at the best restaurant in the world before that title goes to a far away restaurant you know?"
190,5.0 star rating,"If Heaven has a Restaurant....Eleven Madison Park is our culinary life as we might imagine perfection, how our lives would be if we were the heads of state of some remote, resource rich principality, and could order up transcendent dining experiences at the clap of our majestic, princely hands.  In short, it is the Best Restaurant in the History of Food. From the moment one enters the foyer, until one departs, the experience is one of seamless perfection.  There is a choreography to Eleven Madison Park.  The service is efficiency blanketed by a layer of warmth.  Bright, scrubbed, attentive with a fluidity and ballet of movement one would expect to find in fine Swiss watches or at the Mariinsky Theater.And the food...the FOOD!  Each new flavor is an explosion of Pure Joy!  Even things that sound as if they do not remotely go together pirouette wonderfully on the palate.  It's as if the chefs there have invented new colors.What truly separates Eleven Madison Park from the other Titans of Manhattan is their ability to improvise on the fly with effortless cool.  A Don Draper/Miles Davis/Ernest Hemingway-liberating-the-bar-at-the-Ritz-Hotel-in-the-Place-Vendome level of cool.  Go.  Eat.  Transcend.  It will be the type of meal you speak about years from now in hushed tones.  If Heaven has a restaurant, it is Eleven Madison Park."
191,1.0 star rating,"First visit here, it was world class, one of the best meals of my life. Second visit here it was on the worst experiences of my life. Service was sub par, expected so much better from the #1 restaurant in the world. Food has taken the simplicity route far too much. The famous duck which I loved on the initial visit tasted far too salty and dry. Many of the dishes tasted too one dimensional."
192,4.0 star rating,"After looking forward to EMP, the ""world's best restaurant"" for a year, I finally got a chance to visit with a few coworkers.  EMP recently went through a massive renovation and was closed for a while and though I'm not sure what it looked like before, I can comment that the decor inside is not bright but not dim, clean, and fresh.  It's not the overly fancy kind of decor you'd expect from such a place, in my opinion.  Service was superb, as it should be for a place with this kind of reputation.  People were pulling out my chairs, replacing napkins, and always around.  We started off with gift boxes around our table for 6 which was strange, as I had expected real gifts and not food in them.. definitely a nice touch for the holiday season.  Inside there were a few starters/amuse bouche.  Given the menu changes all the time here, it's probably not too valuable to go into detail about everything.  The highlight of the starters was the caviar, though I wasn't too big of a fan of the play on bagels and cream cheese thing they did - seemed a little cheap if I dare say.For some of your dishes, you are given a choice of 1-3 options.  Next, I chose the cold foie gras, layered in between cabbage. Literally amazing.  I had the tilefish after that, which was very mustardy and kind of took away from the flavor of the flaky fish.  There was then a presentation of a pumpkin which sounds weird, but it was kind of cool.  They opened it up in front of you and then took it away and served the most melt in your mouth pumpkin with a light broth.  In between dishes, we got an (expensive?) bottle of wine and the sommelier did a really cool presentation where they basically melted off the neck of a wine bottle - would recommend this for anyone who feels bougie.Next was the most DELICIOUS piece of seared duck with Sichuan peppercorn ever.  Favorite dish of the night.  This rivals Momofuku Ko's duck which was one of my favorites also.There were a few little side dishes and what not, but nothing to call home about.  We got a play on pretzels, cheese and beer that I really wasn't a huge fan of, but everyone else loved it.For dessert, we all shared all the options except the cranberry one and they were all amazing, especially the apple cider donut.  At the end we also got ""chocolate pretzels"".All in all, a divine dining experience that everyone should absolutely do once, but I would not quite say this was the most amazing meal or dining experience of my life... I just wasn't blown away as I was expecting to be given EMP's rep, but it was still a damn good meal."
193,5.0 star rating,"This experience was truly sublime. It's no wonder this is the #1 restaurant in the world! I came here with my family to celebrate my 21st birthday and the staff went above and way way waaaay BEYOND to make my birthday special. They even made me an extremely cute personalized driver's license ID (which involved them running to a nearby Staples to get it laminated). Because it was my 21st birthday, I got two cocktails. I first tried to seaweed one...which i LOVED. I followed that up with the apple cocktail, which was also very good. In terms of food, it was all really exciting! Everything was presented very beautifully. I especially loved the savory cheesecake course. The so-called ""caviar"" course was a very fun homage to NYC, and the everything bagel crust was very wow. Another standout was the cookies and cream dessert. My only complaint was that I wanted more. My family and I also raved about the beer, cheese, and pretzel fondue course, the scallop broth and bread course, and the scallop and uni course. Each and every course, however, was simply amazing. I licked every plate they put in front of me clean."
194,2.0 star rating,"As many other foodies. if given a chance to experience the #1 restaurant in the world. you do it!. that said I've been to other Awesome stared Michelin restaurants, and this one was just a disappointment. big expectations, absolutely no delivery. All name, food didn't back it up!. First of all please understand that at no point would I call this a ""bad"" restaurant, the food is fancy enough, showy enough, and what I do believe they excel in (the service) is good enough. but kept on feeling cheated almost, as in if I was experiencing a restaurant that got to the top, and just gave up. I would even doubt that the head chef was at the helm that night, there was so many letdowns.To the good, you are received like they know you, there is no checking a list or even waiting (at the start) if you arrive on time you will be seated right away and handed over to a very capable waitress, a drink specialist, and another team member whose entire job seemed to be to set up the table and sweep it up when done (though even that stopped after the 4th course -  of an 8 course dinner). the drinks that were recommended where just plain outstanding (wine and a cocktail) so the bartender knows his stuff!...the restaurant is big, huge for new York standards  actually and nicely decorated for the holidays...  and that's where I'm going to have to stop the ""good"".To the not so good. granted we were there on the 20th of December, it was my Birthday and were celebrating our upcoming nuptials (all of which they remembered - and mentioned). after the redesign that they went through mid year I really thought they would have come up with a personal, awesome, romantic set up. nope. very few main tables (weird for a place that big) we were seated by some booths by the bar area, arms reach from the next two tables, and right by the entrance to the bathroom areas, it was very loud oh so loud, half the time you couldn't really hear the waiter when she nicely tried to explain the dishes in front of us. the color, the booth, the set up. really made me think of a Vegas all you can eat joint. lighting could have made it a bit better, but they decided on this yellow tint bulbs, I guess to make the place more romantic?. well when you mess up the rest, the noise, and you are so close to the next table, that you might as well call it family style dinning. dimming the lights to a darkish yellow, is just frustrating, because it makes all of the food they present you with, look gray and very unappetizing. To the food. again, not bad. yet again, doubt the main head chef (and owner now I guess) was there, the food is minimalistic, which is to be expected when you go for an 8 course menu, definitely more leaning to French than American. that said if I was to call the main ingredient of the night, I would say it was SALT. they go heavy on the salt on everything. the bread rolls have salt (and sea salt to the side), every dish is Salt heavy, even the desert (ice cream) had sea salt sprinkled over it. now I got absolutely nothing against salt. if anything my fiancé is the one that was suffering because she does hate salt heavy dishes, but this was extreme and completely unbalanced, there was nothing in the plate to run to in order to tune it down. no acid, no butter sauce. just salty stuff packed over salty stuff. there were some dishes that reminded me that we were at a fancy restaurant (like the duck - I thought it was good enough for a great French spot - absolutely not good enough for Michelin). but then there were others that just left me feeling cheated. a mushroom dish that was nothing that a huge mushroom on the dish with some type of sauce. again I LOVE Mushrooms. but when you see a dish consisting of just one thing, you expected to blow your mind. nope. together with the lighting (which made it look like a weird brown blob on the dish, it tasted like nothing. really nothing. no explosion of flavor. no awesome taste of mushroom. just tasted like a mushroom soaked in beef stock (not even, maybe vegie stock). the initial offering of caviar and an assortment of little jars of jellies. was just that. tasted like canned stuff.again not bad. but THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD!! I don't expect to taste canned food!. caviar was good. but so tamed that all I tasted was the cream cheese under it actually... then came a pate dish. that was just one big slice of pate. I guess we were expected to eat it with the salty rolls, but since they came at different times and there was no good explanation of the dish left me to try the pate on its own. big mistake!. flavorless!. it tasked like eating butter. but not good butter. again, I like pate and love French food. this was neither.  The duck dish was ok, but there was barely any on the plate, same with the veal. barely any there and what was there was flavorless paired with a Salty sauce.At the end for $700+... for a dinner for two... this was not close to worth it. $50 a plate I would be closer"
195,3.0 star rating,"The best restaurant in the world is ok. Which in and of itself is a shocking statement. 3, maybe 4 stars. 5? No. It was excellent, perhaps, even in spots. But for the all hype and accolades the food, and service was underwhelming. The wait staff was kind, and generally attentive. But there were small missteps. Dribbled wine. A fork was dropped and landed on my suit jacket. There were errors on the check, overcharging us for several glasses of wine we didn't have. The food was even a bit boring, and monochromatic. The lobster was over cooked. The prezel bun/cheese dish was fine but really not for $300 a person. The desserts werenot particularly inventive. It was all fine, and anywhere else, at some other price point it would be excellent. But it doesn't hold a candle to Stone Barns. I'd eat at VIctoria and Albert's over 11 Madison Park given the choice."
196,5.0 star rating,"Although it has taken me over four years to write this review, the ability to reflect and compare has allowed me to still call EMP my no. 1 restaurant experience to date with great fondness. After different 1 star, 2 star and 3 star experiences in North America and Europe, EMP still takes the cake. The food was imaginative, superb. The service was spot on. I can't wait to try EMP 2.0 after the renovation soon enough."
197,3.0 star rating,"Eleven Madison Park - the world's number one restaurant for 2017 as we all know and when you make plans to eat at the world's best the expectations sky rocket and I guess that's where I went wrong. We got here on a Wednesday evening for a 9 pm reservation. It was my birthday so I thought what better place to have dinner than EMP. We were greeted at the door by their very courteous and professional staff , seated in the lounge till our table was ready and started off with our drinks. Cranberry cocktail was very refreshing even on a cold night and the Sauv was crisp and fruity , great selection. We were seated at our table in 15 minutes and our first course that included Caviar , Beet with trout roe , cucumber with pumpernickel & salmon , potato with quail egg & mustard and Mackerel wit fennel & salmon was adjust served in gift boxes - a perfect gesture to a birthday celebration. We opened the boxes and found all these treats. It was served with everything bagel and crackers , this was a great way to start and I told myself this is totally worth all the wait. Everything mentioned above was delicious especially potato with quail egg and the caviar. It was fresh and full of flavour. My taste buds felt they were in wizard of oz. Foie Gras with cabbage and apple follows next. I have had Foie Gras all the way from Beijing to LA and I felt it did not keep up with the way things started , the flavour was dull and didn't quite hold itself. Next was Tilefish with parsnip and pike roe. I was excited for the tilefish until I was not. The parsnip and pike roe sounded it would go perfect with tilefish but again the flavour fell short. I felt they just did not blend well together and the flavour fell flat. Following the tilefish was pumpkin roasted with seaweed and bacon. It was brought to the table and cut in front of us. It smelt delicious and once presented to us with pork broth an absolute delight to eat. The flavour was perfect and the aroma just added to the texture and taste. The main entree succeeded the pumpkin. I had the duck that is aged for 3 weeks glazed with honey , lavender and apple. I like duck because of the savoury flavour it carries usually. The glazing is the craftsmanship of a genius but disappointingly the duck was dried out a little more than normal which made it like any other protein just hard and deprived of its flavour. It was served with kale with pearl onion and potato confit to share which were both very decent.   My favourite part of every meal to end the dinner - dessert. I had apple cider doughnut with cinnamon ice cream , you can never go wrong with that. Very well done. Finally a masterly crafted chocolate covered pretzel which cleansed the palate pretty well. Dessert I felt was average but at EMP I guess I wasn't expecting average. The berry combination that my friend had was actually very delicious and something you'd expect at a place like this. We were brought a bottle of signature of EMP apple brandy to sip , on the house and it was pretty solid. If I already hadn't had 3 glasses of wine I would've definitely enjoyed it more. To wrap up the evening we were brought a small bag to take home which had our menu folded in a tiny box along with some granola. A very beautiful gesture and elegantly presented. To summarise , the staff went above and beyond , very pleasant and accommodating. The food was good overall but when at a place like this or at the best restaurant in the world you expect something much better than you can find elsewhere. I was a little bit disappointed but as I said in the beginning maybe I just had too high of expectations. I compared it Oriole which I felt surpassed them in flavour. Thank you EMP for the experience :)"
198,4.0 star rating,"EMP has always been held in high regard by any food lover -- and even so much more after being named #1 in the world for 2017.  I liked the ambiance as it was not too dark or quiet.  The service was amazing as to be expected.  Much thought was given to the presentation of the food too.  This creativity was shown from the second we sat down.  The first course was a surprise -- caviar and accompaniments hidden in wrapped boxes, waiting to be open.  We really enjoyed the presentation and the caviar proved to be one of our favorite courses.  The rest of the food, however, did not really live up to hype.  I wished the creativity carried over to the flavors of the remaining dishes.  While the dishes tried to bring new flavors to life (e.g., foie gras and beets, pumpkin with seaweed and bacon, etc.), the blending of some of the ingredients just did not flow.  Should you try it out?  Sure.  Is it the best restaurant in the world in my book?  No.But, who am I?  Just a hungry guy willing to pay to be enlightened."
199,3.0 star rating,"Being the foodie that I am, I had to check out the world's #1 restaurant when I was in New York. It was really all hype and no sizzle. If I was rating this restaurant based on service alone, it would easily be a 5 star. However, factoring in the food, it brought it down to a 3. There was simply no single dish that blew me away. We had to make reservations as soon as it was available, and even then, we had to settle for the 9:45PM slot. Everything from the atmosphere to the service to the opening presentation was great. However, when the food started to arrive, the disappointment started to set in. There were a few good dishes, don't get me wrong (foie gras, duck, berry dessert). I just did not feel like it was up to my standards. Maybe I walked in with such high standards given its reputation, but I left wanting more. If you got the wine pairing, they gave you a kitchen tour, so that was a cool touch.They gave us the menu and a jar of granola as a takeaway, which was cool as a keepsake. The experience was awesome, but the food just fell short, and that's really what it comes down to, right?"
200,5.0 star rating,"Certainly will go down as one of the most memorable dinners my husband and I have experienced! I love tasting menus and this one was amazing! The service is what sets this restaurant a part, definitely recommend!"
201,3.0 star rating,"Service is exceptional! Waiters/waitresses are very attentive yet are not disturbing at all. Very friendly and considerate. The food is creative and tasty, although I would say the ingredients may not be of the best quality. After visiting the restaurant again after the renovation, I like to revise the rating to 3 stars. The entire room is dimmer and more crowded. Service is not as good as before. The food doesn't have as many wow factors."
202,5.0 star rating,"What a great experience! The opening truffle surprises, sturgeon cheesecake, fois gras dishes, seafood dishes, roasted pumpkin, duck, and cranberry dessert were all amazing! The new decor and service was on point. Great job!I will admit that the dishes challenge you think about how to slice, cut, portion out each bite. It can be frustrating for some, but it's part of the experience IMO. Highly recommended! You pay when you reserve (like a ticket) so there wasn't a money exchange at the end of the meal."
203,5.0 star rating,"Wow, what an honor to dine at the number one restaurant in the world. When we arrived for Sunday brunch, the table looked quite festive with several wrapped gifts. To our surprise, our entire first course was inside the presents. The first box I opened had a tin of caviar over creme fraiche with crumbled egg around the sides. I honestly felt like a kid at Christmas opening the other boxes. Each had a wonderful culinary surprise inside. Even the napkins and caviar spoon had their own box. Every course that followed was absolutely amazing. Our fantastic server Liz complimented the experience. Check off another bucket list item!"
204,5.0 star rating,"Literally one of the most amazing dining experiences I've ever had! The comfort we felt from the moment we walked it to the when we were handed our coats and ""gift"" bags was a true statement of proper hospitality. The food itself is a masterpiece of precision and culinary manipulation in the highest form. The service and presentation are unobtrusive yet exceedingly attentive. Every course was a picture waiting to be taken and the flavors were just perfect. near the end of the meal we were invited into the kitchen for a tour = side note if ever presented with the opportunity to tour or view an kitchen the caliber of Eleven Madison Park = TAKE IT! It is a show in an of itself. Once in the kitchen (after a view of the stations busy at work) we were presented with a Sumac Tea ""ceremony"" - just WOW. The courses we have are in my picture feed because as they say a picture is worth a thousand words!!! My final recommendation is if you ever have the opportunity to go to Eleven Madison Park - DO NOT PASS IT UP. It is a true culinary experience that should not be missed!"
205,5.0 star rating,"I thought that no restaurant could meet the hype that EMP has.  I was wrong. We had a perfect meal.  The servers made you feel like you were the wittiest most wonderful customers that they had ever served.  I agree not every dish was an o-wow for my palate, but way more than a majority were either excellent or superb.  Eating at EMP is more than going to a restaurant, it is a five senses experience that should be savored."
206,3.0 star rating,"The anticipation is better than the actual experience.  It is one of those places that you have to book months in advance.  It is a 3 star Michelin restaurant and recently voted ""world's best"".  We booked a table for four to celebrate our 40th anniversary.Most of the yelp reviews gave high marks for their service oriented preparations.  Instead, I was surprised when our server asked what was the occasion for dining with them, after hearing it was for our anniversary; then she asked if there was also a birthday celebration. Yes, but it is four weeks away.  I was not impressed !The food was creative and meticulously plated.  A very good sampling menu with fresh ingredients.  But it just didn't do it for us.  For our final dessert course, I was disappointed that we did not even get a lit candle for our anniversary picture.  The highlight of the evening was the tour of the kitchen briefly. At least we can say, been there, done that ..."
207,2.0 star rating,"Really? This restaurant is supposed to be number 1 in the world? Maybe if you like Good Humor bars.Number 1 is an accolade that never should have been awarded to EMP. The foie gras, usually a favorite, is so rich and tasteless it is completely unappetizing. The tiny piece of lobster is ok, but covered in salty ""bisque."" The dessert is a good humor bar on one side of the plate and blob of thick whipped cream on the other (""cookies and cream""); otherwise you can have ""berries and pears,"" which includes about 5 berries, 3 small pieces of pear with some berry-colored sweet cream balls. The caviar and lamb were good, but for $155 per person this meal is a complete disappointment! If you want to be further humiliated, try the larger meal for $295.The service is excellent."
208,5.0 star rating,"This was one of the best meals I have had in a long time.  Gracious and knowledgeable service, very well educated sommelier, beautiful, classy setting and a marvelous menu - unbelievable flavor profiles.  I would highly recommend."
209,2.0 star rating,"What a huge disappointment. My wife and I are doing what one may call ""Michelin Star"" tour. This was our second 3 star in NYC, after Per Se. To clarify, we are recent transplants in NYC so we try the tick down the list, but we have done visits mostly internationally. Let me leave the guessing out - if Pete Wells of the New York Times was visiting Eleven Madison tonight (Nov. 23rd), his review would have likely sent a shock-wave throughout the world of fine dining.  I'll leave the food out, for the most part, as one can say it was Thanksgiving so the chef clearly just phoned it in. No creativity whatsoever, bland taste and very little flavor. Instead, i'll focus on the service, but circle back to the food later. The service was awful. I wish there was another way to put it but from start to finish, it was just not good. I don't want to bore anyone with play-by-play so here are the highlights: cocktail glass and wine glass empty without being asked to refill or alternative. Server couldn't answer questions about the gluten free bread my wife was having. Very little check in throughout the meal, rushed service and very impersonal and lastly it took more than 5 minutes to find our coats as we were leaving. I must address the food after all. No Amuse-bouche, absolutely no accommodation to gluten free - my wife's dessert was a joke of 12 berries put together, super small portions, only 3 courses, no cheese or after dinner cocktail offering and then again very bland food. Overall, felt very rushed and that no one from the staff really wanted to be there. For the $300/pp price tag, it was a complete rip off. I don't recommend it at all, the space itself doesn't feel intimate like Per Se or Masa, the lighting is bad and again, just not worth the price. Be aware."
210,5.0 star rating,"Such an amazing experience!  I've been a few 3 star Michelin restaurants, but none gave me the comfort of being at home while providing the most excellent service.  Our server was the best!  He saw our giant DSLRs ready to shoot the perfection of this food, and made sure we got all our shots (even being so kind as to be a hand model for some of the bottles that were brought out).  What really impressed me though, was the fact that when asked about allergies, my brother replied ""I'm not allergic to anything, but I really dislike vegetables.""  Now most restaurants would smile and nod and serve the dishes anyway, but what surprised us the most was that our server only asked if he was okay with vegetable garnishes and was off!What came next was completely unexpected.  The dishes they replaced the vegetables dishes with were tastier than me & my friend's.  When dishes were paired with veggies, they doubled up on meat for him, while still leaving the vegetable portion as a type of garnish I suppose.  We had an AMAZING experience, and all of us still talk about this place every time someone brings up New York.  Definitely a spot I will return to, and that granola... SO FREAKIN BOMB!!!"
211,5.0 star rating,"I find it a bit ridiculous that I'm writing a Yelp review for a 3-star michelin restaurant. However, just wanted to write that I had a spectacular time! I loved the amuse bouche especially, like the oysters! Every dish was creative and perfect. The entire experience was like a continuous symphony of flavors in my mouth! The place has a lovely ambiance and I truly enjoyed my experience here."
212,5.0 star rating,"Best food and service stuff. Everything that I ate was delicious. Nice drinks, really well balanced coctails. They really care about your experience. Overall I'd recommend this spot. But first maybe call ahead and check for free seats."
213,2.0 star rating,"We're waiting for our Uber, having just had my long awaited birthday dinner, and I had to share our disappointment with anyone considering the ""best restaurant in the world."" First, we ordered a drink and had two full courses until we asked two separate servers if it was on its way, a full 25 minutes after ordering it. Then, we waited 15-20 minutes after each course with dirty plates. We were rarely checked up on and the staff seemed entirely disinterested in whether we were enjoying our meal. The dishes were vaguely described and uninspired. For example, we were served a custom beer and then told it would be incorporated into the following dishes but when we were served the next course, no one mentioned it. We felt like we were on an assembly line and the vibe was super impersonal. At most restaurants of this caliber, you feel like you are a welcome guest. Here, we felt like we were just another mouth to feed. The food was not creative or even very palatable. It felt like their MO was to dump caviar or fois gras on a dish and voila. Unfortunately, the highlight of our evening was the bread and butter. Absolutely not worth the money, or our time."
214,5.0 star rating,"We made it in for the first time before EMP closed down for the summer renovations.  The ticket system to get a reservation was smooth and you get to pay for dinner in advance .  The tasting menu consisted of EMP's greatest hits, a retrospective of dishes from past to present.  Two parting gifts of granola and a tin of chocolates ended a fabulous meal."
215,5.0 star rating,The hotel has been beautifully updated and the friendly helpful staff could not be nicer to guests. The smaller size of the hotel provides a pleasant feeling of home. The breakfast provided is the perfect start to your day with the staff providing personal service to each guest in the bright first floor sitting area.
216,5.0 star rating,"Excellent. 10/10 I loved everything about my experience here. Food is exceptional, service was on point, newly renovated interiors very well done. There's a reason they received three Michelin stars."
217,3.0 star rating,"Have you ever walked away from a restaurant disappointed and wanting a ""do over meal"" from somewhere that's actually good?  That was me. My review is probably harsh and nitpicky but I can list other restaurants that have outdone EMP in different areas. 4 star service - wait staffs were attentive but they fell short personalization and synchronization.A)    Personalization - before arriving, EMP contacts you to see if it's a special occasion, if you have any food allergies or dietary restrictions.  We went there for our anniversary and not that I am looking for complimentary toast or dessert but no one mentioned or congratulated us on our anniversary.  That was a minor miss.  The bigger misses were in the beginning.  The wait staff asked again if we had any food allergies or food aversion.  We said no.  But the survey was already taken the day before so it would be nice for the staff to reconfirm our answer rather than re-asking the same question we already answered. B)    Synchronization - this is an observation on the party of 6 table in front of us where plates were not served in sync.  It was a table of 3 ladies and 3 gentlemen with 3 wait staff serving.  The plates came out the same time but placing it on the table was off and at one point a gentleman was served first before the plate was served to the lady (Big Gasp right?!?).  This SUPER nitpicky but I always remember how well Del Posto executed their plate-serving synchronization when we went as a group of 5.3 star food/menu - there were no physical menus presented but the server spoke about the options.  I personally appreciate visually seeing what's on the menu and the components in the dish so I can be more engaged with my dishes incase I have questions on the ingredients.  The food itself was good but it was nothing mind blowing except for the caviar dish for me.  That was amazing!  The food in general was good but not memorable.  It was bland and maybe it's the menu served that day but it's missing complexity.  That especially goes for the lobster dish which is essentially the tail plus some bisque which by the way my husband had a piece of shell on his dish. The presentation was lacking.  Same plates were used throughout the meal and nothing creative with plating.  Our wine pairing glasses had more character than the plates.  Per Se definitely takes the cake in everything but especially in presentation.  One negative note on the food is the duck.  I'm a huge duck fan and whenever that's an option on the menu, that would be my go to.  I felt mine was overcooked and had to send it back for a more medium/pink center one.  The replacement one came and it was still over cooked to the point where it was super hard for me to cut with the smooth edge knife they served it with.  I felt a serrated knife would be a more proper utensil pairing but they did not have any in the restaurant. 4 star cocktail drinks - drinks were good and good presentation but of course it doesn't compare drinks at Flatiron Room, Raines Law Room, etc. 3 star ambiance/décor - the space is big and open with very high ceilings with a modern look but it's not warm, engaging or stimulating.  For a good ambiance décor restaurant, Daniel would be the top contender for me."
218,4.0 star rating,"I can't believe I'm giving ""The Best Restaurant in the World"" a 4 star rating. Completely missing the WOW factor you expect as far as food is concerned. And I'm usually extremely generous with 5 star ratings. But if you're going to be #1 you have to really be #1. Honestly the ambiance, service, and attention to detail is top top. It's why they're rated what they are. But the food was only good! It's so disappointing! I expected flavors, dishes I'd wish I could try again but wouldn't be able to until I somehow came back here. Not 1. If it wasn't for the service I'd say my rating would be a 3, maybe even a 2 because of price. I think the missing factor was that the food was bland. In fact the newly renovated venue was pretty bland and underwhelming as well.Now for the positives! Did a tour of the kitchen, it's totally calm and huge and clean and beautiful. Real masterpiece back there since the renovations. There's a real relaxing vibe to the place, that was great. You also get about 10 different servers come to you throughout the night, felt like we were hosted by the whole kitchen - staff really cares about what they do and take it super seriously. That was nice. I think they also do a great job of accommodating. If I had an allergy, or didn't like a certain type of food, you get the impression they'll drive over to McDonald's to get you a burger if that's what they think you really want and to accommodate you. Unfortunately I eat everything and I'm not a picky difficult person so I couldn't benefit personally from that level of accommodation they definitely excel at. Bottom line: they need to rethink their tasting menu because if you're #1, you can't have ok dishes. The dishes were just ok. Nothing amazing. Everyone I was with agreed. I've ate at many Michelin star rated restaurants and high end restaurants in general. EMP you have to really please introduce some WOW factor into the menu because everything was just OK."
219,5.0 star rating,"Currently, this is the best restaurant I have ever had the opportunity to eat at.The amuse bouche was the second best thing I have ever eaten (pear apple lobster curry). Fine dining without the obnoxiousness.Was so lucky - got kinda drunk and was talking a lot about the food. I think they thought I was a Michelen/Zagat Inspector and Daniel Humm came out of the kitchen. He had been cooking that night because he was going on the Today Show the next morning and was nervous. Sat at my table talking for 5-10 minutes. Good, good, dude. I didn't realize chefs at that ""level"" could be so humble.Can't wait to go back."
