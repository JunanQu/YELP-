70,2018-07-07,5.0,"This was one of my favorite tasting menu experiences. It was fancy but still managed to feel upbeat and relaxed. Everything we had was delicious and unique. The staff was fun and the presentation of everything was incredible. Not to mention we were sent away with a tin that we ate out of earlier full of our menu, and a big jar of granola for breakfast! My absolute favorites of the night were the egg salad asparagus and snow pea fish egg starters, the bread (tasted like a croissant!), the incredible caviar course with a savory cheesecake and everything bagel crust, my amazing spring salad, the lobster, the table grilled snails with morels, and my mom's chocolate dessert! At the end of our meal we also received a chocolate pretzel and a small glass of apple cider that was the perfect thing to end on! Loved this place. Super duper satisfied and had a lot of fun :)",0.4671296296296296,158,8.466666666666667,65.53207217943964

73,2018-07-06,2.0,"I've been to a lot of fine dining restaurants and this is probably the worst fine dining experience I've ever had. The food was very mediocre and the service was even worse. The servers were pretty cold. Especially we went to Per Se the day before, and the service we received was just more than perfect. People there were very warm and genuine. However we didn't feel that way at eleven Madison. It feels like the servers didn't even want to talk to us at all. And after the dinner, we had really bad stomachache. This never happened to us with any other fine dining restaurants. The restaurant is overrated and doesn't deserve what we paid. I'm very disappointed",-0.016875,125,21.191304347826087,-9.222926997437071
74,2018-07-02,4.0,"We came here for dinner this past weekend. It has been a few years since we've been here but remembered how creative in taste and presentation it was, so was really excited. They also reno the restaurant last summer so curious how it looked.  The restaurant appearance seems a bit more simplistic than before but when you have super high ceilings, column-free, and large windows like that I guess not much needs to be done.  The service was near impeccable. A couple of times when we returned to the table there should have been someone to pull the table out to let my partner back into the seat.  The food, which included lobster,lamb and duck, was very good but fell short of expectations. Nothing really blew us away - taste or presentation. And if you don't eat any bread, which is excellent, one might not feel very full.  FYI - they no longer have the Gruyere Gougeres (we call it cheese puffs) so that was disappointing.  We ordered 3 wines by the glass that went well with the meal so likely a better option than the $175 wine pairing for many wines you might not be familiar with or varietals and blends you dont care for.  We went to Jean George last year and to us that was more of a Michelin 3-star worthy/top rated restaurant in the world experience.  We also went to Le Cinq (also top Michelin rated) in Paris last year and that was a superior gastro experience to Eleven Madison and worthy of the price and accolades, so make sure you reserve early if you plan on going there.  We'll go back to Le Cinq and Jean George. Eleven Madison, maybe we'll go back again in a few years.",0.2098875661375661,299,21.183333333333334,25.162588499907542

82,2018-06-24,5.0,"So hard to get into, but so worth the drama and the wait. After contacting the restaurant for their next round of reservations, I was clicking on the computer seconds before the clock struck to ensure I got a reservation and obviously.....GOOOAAALLLL! (You have to be a soccer fan to understand the point I am making).For those of you who cannot get a reservation, they do have a bar area that looked really live and for the most part, you do have the same menu,  just not as many dishes due to the lack of space. Some dishes come with quite the presentation which you should expect. I scored a tour of the kitchen and I was so appreciative as the experience never gets old. They had row upon row of ducks hanging and it reminded me of an image you might see in a cartoon except this image was very real and I knew within a short period of time, I would be dining on one of those ducks. The entire staff that I came into contact with were very professional and courteous. Rene was my server and she was wonderful. They definitely know how to take care of their guests which was shocking to discover that they do not accept gratuity! I have dined all over the world as some of the most exquisite restaurants and this is the first time that I have encountered one of this quality where gratuity was not necessary. The food was exquisite and while there is no need to go into detail about every dish as the menu changes seasonally, the lavender crusted duck was magnificent. The flavors....wow.So, Eleven stares the #1 spot with French Laundry, except the biggest difference is at FL, they gave me so many desserts, I felt like I was Marie Antoinette and I was in heaven as dessert is so my thing. Eleven is way more conservative on this point. I had a choice of 1 dessert, I also got their infamous delish chocolate covered pretzel with a shot of apple brandy and to go, I was presented with their granola with blueberries which I savored over the course of 2 days. Um, can I buy this granola on a regular basis? It's that damn good!Eleven is such a treat and I hope to be able to make it a yearly tradition to dine here.",0.2253030303030303,404,18.736363636363635,45.75225864415006

85,2018-06-22,4.0,"This place has plenty of people who work here. Nice people who smile but at points can look really stressed or body guard like. But our servers were nice, the previous comment was my observations of other servers running around. Pour water nicely and place silverware and plating symmetrically. Ask any of the servers a question about the food and they'll know where it's from.The 5 course:1.Caviar, ham, green jello, Benedict sauce, egg yolk, and homemade English muffin.2. House break, tasted like croissants and the butter had cheese crumbles, that was yum.3. Salad, I had ceviche, bf and his dad had the liver. We all tasted each other's, and I liked the salad the most, then ceviche, then liver. Kris (bf) said the strawberry is too strong in the liver. 4. Lobster claw. Very delicious!5. Main dish: 2 dishes lamb and the other 2 duck breast. I love the lamb, had two different parts: one fatty and the other shredded. The duck breast was super delicious as well.6. Ended with dessert: chocolate, strawberry, and cheese (goat). All separate dishes, my fav was the strawberry. We didn't understand why it took roughly 15 minutes longer or shorter between dishes.

After left the restaurant, I barely remember any dishes we had without looking at the photo we took. And we had four dishes of daikon.

89,2018-06-15,2.0,"After 4+ years of living in New York and countless restaurant experiences that ranged from the good to the bad to the ugly, I finally decided to join Yelp after eating at Eleven Madison Park.  While I don't consider myself a ""foodie"" by any means, I do get to eat at the fancier NYC restaurants by virtue of my job, so I'd like to think I'm not a total rube.  I read a lot of reviews prior to going to EMP to get a better idea of what to expect, and I have to assume there is a certain degree of confirmation bias involved when reflecting on a meal that cost upwards of $500 pp, because no one wants to admit that they spent a fortune on an unremarkable experience.  EMP was certainly an experience unlike any I've ever had, but when it comes down to it the food was not outstanding and, I hate to say it... disappointing.  Leaving, I couldn't name a single dish that wowed me or that left me wanting to come back.  This also may be colored by the fact that the waitstaff gave me the same feeling I get when I'm followed around a store (fellow people of color will know what I mean), and I'm also pretty sure I got food poisoning but more on that later.THE GOOD:The day before our reservation, the restaurant reached out to ask if we were celebrating anything special.  We didn't respond, but did share what we were celebrating and got a very cute gift related to that after our meal.All of the waitstaff was super knowledgable and attentive, and answered silly questions we had about the MetLife building and what was going on at other tables.  The highlight of our night was watching the waitstaff very capably escort out a table of very drunk patrons.The wine pairing was very very good, with flavors that coordinated remarkably with the food.The decor and ambiance is very pretty.The wine pours are heavy! I didn't drink much, but definitely understood how that table got so drunk.  Plus, the last course comes with a bottle of apple brandy to drink to your heart's desire.THE BADI don't know if we looked less affluent than the other guests (or perhaps more brown?), but every time we asked a question about what was going on at another table the servers acted like we were trying to scam our way into getting something for free.  Just expressing some curiosity! You would too if you saw the crazy stuff going on around the dining room! The food seemed targeted at a non-NYC audience, with kitschy dishes like a savory black and white cookie and a play on a lox bagel in the form of a cheesecake served with caviar.  I'm not a fan of touristy experiences, but if you are this may be a pro.While the dishes all had unique flavors, some were outright bland.  The fluke and bass for example were really lacking in the flavor department.You leave with a printed out menu and some EMP granola.  The next morning, I felt a little funny and ate some granola, thinking I was just hungry.  I then had some pretty bad stomach issues, and since everything I ate in the prior 12+ hours was from EMP I'm pretty sure it was something I ate.  Although I did have wine, I didn't drink very much and left the dinner sober so it was not a hangover.Overall, if EMP is on your bucket list for the experience you should go.  But if you're more concerned with food than theatre when you eat,   you can get a better meal at a peer (or even less prestigious) restaurant.  I also can't shake the feeling of being othered, so if you're a POC I hope you leave feeling differently, but here's some fair warning that you may be looked at sideways.",0.0645251494537209,678,10.5375,15.51263774018571

93,2018-06-10,5.0,"We dined at EMP tonight to celebrate a birthday. Let me begin by saying there are many reasons why EMP is the World's Best restaurant. While the food is absolutely delicious, full of fresh ingredients and with innovative flavors, it is the service and attention to details that stand out the most. The EMP staff is Phenomenal!!!! Absolutely Phenomenal! This is most well managed and run restaurant I have ever been to. The restaurant runs smoothly with high attention to details. Everything is perfection. When we first arrived, we were greeted by our first names. We were welcomed by many lovely EMP staff members- all were smiling and welcoming. When you walk into the restaurant, you notice the interior is simple yet elegant. Beautiful purple flowers were in the dining room tonight as well as sophisticated artwork hanging on the walls. It is airy and bright inside. EMP is not stuffy or haughty. The atmosphere is relaxed and calm. Once inside we were seated immediately to begin dinner. My friend was greeted with a Happy Birthday card at the table. EMP staff came over to wish her well. This alone was very personable and greatly appreciated. The drink menu is extensive with wines, cocktails, tea, coffees to choose from. We sampled two non- alcohol drinks to start the night.  Both were lovely and flavorful. We had the ""bar menu"". This was a delicious 5 course experience of caviar, lamb, duck, lobster and other fresh seasonal vegetables. To finish we enjoyed dessert and chocolate pretzels. Every plate was absolute perfection. Beyond perfection! Clean to taste, spices and herbs were all delicately placed on the dishes, sauces were perfect- not heavy or salty. In fact, the sauces added just the right amount of ""kick"" to each plate. Also I found each plate was the right size serving. When the plates arrived to the table, the staff promptly noted the dish and all of the ingredients while presenting. Overall just perfection. Our evening was made even more special because we were so honored to tour the kitchen and meet Chef Dmitri. He is lovely! Very funny and warm. This moment really was just outstanding. Just a beautiful moment for us as guests to recognize the accomplishments of the Chef and kitchen staff. We each left with a jar of granola.

We were in town for a short vacation, and were so excited about getting to experience this so called number one restaurant in the world! What a shame it only left us with disappointment. Food was below average standard of Michelin 3 star restaurants. New York alone we have visited Le Bernadine, Jean George and Daniels when they were still 3 stars. Food wise Daniels was not as good but still better than 11 Madison Park......Almost everything was sour, from the beginning to just before main dish, and the sesame dessert didn't have any taste other than sourness. The snail dish was the worst, while snail was stiff and chewy, with seasoning that's not really working. One of the snail was not cleaned properly and had ""dirt"" that tasted bitter.I could accept the duck dish as duck meat was cooked alright, while my mom absolutely hated the crispy seasoning on top of duck skin.If without the pictures I took of the food, I would have already forgotten what I have eaten tonight......Apart from food, the atmosphere was more casual compared to other Michelin 3 star restaurants, which is just a matter of preference. Interior decor is bland, nothing adds any characteristics to the space that's worth comment on. As an interior designer, I don't like the way they have the tables placed, boring and awkward. Service is nothing special, definitely not as detailed as the French ones. Waiters are a bit chaotic, and with the way of the tables were placed, the whole time you can see how chaotic they were...... I like the restaurants where you don't see the waiters for most of your dining period, but they always appear magically whenever they need to.

99,2018-06-02,3.0,"Eleven Madison Park pre-renovation used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the world. I was excited to return to Eleven Madison Park post-renovation, especially with its newly appointed status as the world's best restaurant. Also exciting me was that this would be my 50th Michelin Star restaurant visit, so it felt appropriate that the grandest restaurant of them all would be the destination for this occasion. Previously, I had loved the menu, but found service and ambiance too stiff. With this visit, I was pleased to find a new casual vibe to the whole experience, but with all the magic lost from the food.The Good: - Service is now much more casual and friendly compared to my previous visit, and the new dining room is beautiful. I love the more relaxed environment. - Standout dishes were the taste of spring appetizers and the duck. Both were very well prepared and tasty dishes.- The team prepared a special gift for my new job, which was very cute and much appreciated!The Not So Good: - Everything I loved about the previous Eleven Madison Park food-wise has been lost. The whimsy and fun that made this restaurant special-- the carrot grinder, pretzel basket, etc.-- is completely gone, as if this is a whole different restaurant completely. The menu now feels a lot more traditional in its technique and focus, and is a lot more heavy overall despite having a lot less courses than the previous iteration of Eleven Madison Park. Presentation was lacking in my opinion.- Some dishes were really a miss for me unfortunately. Three people at my table deemed the goat cheese dessert inedible because the pungent flavor. The main course of snails and morels also had an unappealing flavor, akin to ""dirt"" by one person at my table. The lobster was tough and chewy, and the savory desserts were an unappealing end to such a heavy menu. - Service lapses. Though the service is (at times overly) friendly, there were a lot of service lapses that you shouldn't be seeing at a 3 Michelin Star restaurant, let alone the World's Best Restaurant. My water was frequently switched between sparkling and still, despite a reminder that I ordered sparkling. Chairs were not pulled out when returning to the table, and one time my napkin wasn't even folded when leaving the table. Dishes were served to the wrong people at the table twice, and plates were not set nor taken in synchronicity. Servers also stumbled over their words quite a bit; we're all human, but that is not quite the level of polish you'd expect here. Now, I know some of these things sound like pretentious quips, but these are things you'd expect to operate flawlessly as this caliber of restaurant and it'd be unfair to not point it out. - I have some more subjective issues with the visit as well. You now have to make decisions on what you want for 4 courses, and I think it'd be a lot easier to provide some sort of menu for these choices instead of a waiter verbally presenting them because it's hard to digest (no pun intended) that many choices. Service was also overly compensating at times, as mentioned above. I love friendly and personable service, but there was a lack of the traditional professionalism I'd expect to see at this caliber of restaurant. Overall, I was disappointed in my visit to Eleven Madison Park. I have such fond memories of my previous visit, and although I love and embrace changes and evolutions to restaurants, I wouldn't even consider this the same restaurant as pre-renovation Eleven Madison Park. The food was the most disappointing aspect; even if it is not my preferred style of food, there were too many objective issues with the food as listed above. Service was really friendly, but it pales in comparison objectively to my other 3-Michelin Star experiences with all the misses mentioned above. Unfortunately, I will not be returning any time soon.

All the food was good, but nothing that would make me want to come back again or insist that other people try.

104,2018-05-27,5.0,"Can anyone give Eleven Madison Park less than 5 stars? Eleven Madison Park has been ranked the number one restaurant in the world and is the holder of 3 Michelin Stars so who am I to give it less than 5 stars (for a Yelp review). Eleven Madison Park is a exactly what you would expect from a 3 Michelin Stars restaurant. The detail to the service, food and cocktails are exceptional. The spacious art deco decor of the restaurant adds to the atmosphere - invokes an air of grandeur that is fitting for the production that will unfold over the 3 hour tasting menu.Daniel Humm's cooking is heart of the hallowed Eleven Madison Park. He is a neo-classicist, a master of pruning the old-fashioned curlicues from the traditional haute cuisine of his training to make the pleasures more modern and direct. We tried the spring tasting menu. Some of the highlights included: (1) cheesecake with smoke sturgeon caviar, (2) lobster butter poached with ginger and dandelion greens, (3) snails grilled with morels and ramps, and (4) lamb with fava bean relish and nepitella.  The dishes were all innovative and creative. It was essentially art on a plate. Dining at Eleven Madison Park will set you back $315 (US) per person (before cocktails). It is definitely worth the price if you enjoy food and fine dining.  Eleven Madison Park is one of the best. I have been asked how Eleven Madison Park compared to other 3 Michelin Stars restaurants such as Per Se, Le Bernardin, Jean-Georges, Joel Robuchon and Alain Ducasse. It is difficult to compare. I enjoyed all of these restaurants. There were dishes that were unique to each of these restaurants that I enjoyed. All of these 3 Michelin Stars restaurants were worth the money paid.  What you have to keep in mind is that a 3 Michelin Stars restaurant is a production - it is the opportunity to experience some of the best dishes prepared by some of the best Chefs in the industry.",0.27037037037037037,340,14.329729729729731,52.380896240990296

115,2018-05-07,4.0,"TLDR: worth checking out for the experience, but have had better food at a lower price point; creative dishes; excellent service; dining in luxuryHave never been to a three star Michelin restaurant before and with its recent renovation and #1 status on The World's 50 Best Restaurants in 2017, Eleven Madison Park seemed like the right pick. Despite its steep price point (~$350 per person for the tasting menu, inclusive of tax and tip), reservations are difficult to come by, so a friend and I planned about a month and a half in advance. Reservations through Tock open up the first of every month at 9am ET for reservations during the subsequent month. We secured a 9pm reservation on a Friday through the help of the American Express Concierge.On the night of our reservation, we were warmly greeted by the hostesses and had our coats checked. The main dining room was bright and elegant, with high ceilings, large windows, crown moulding, modern chandeliers, and white table cloth tables. The bar area was a bit more intimate, with dim lighting, a fully-stocked back-lit bar, and large lounge chairs.Service was impeccable, where everyone addressed you by your name, took extra precaution around allergies, and generally made you feel like royalty. Our meal lasted about four hours, and we decided to order a bottle of red wine to pair with our tasting menu. Luckily, they gave us a tin with a paper accordion listing everything we ate (listed below with commentary). I can't remember when it was served, but there was also a bread course with salted butter. The bread was soft, warm, buttery, and generally amazing--we enjoyed it so much we got two servings of it. We were also given a tin of granola to take home.  1. Black and white cookie with cheddar and apple - small savory bites; kind of reminded me of fancy cheez-its in regards to taste2. Asparagus with smoked egg salad, daikon with ramps and pike roe, quail egg with radish and mustard greens, and spring peas with trout roe and lemon - served on wooden hexagons; light and refreshing3. Cheesecake with smoked sturgeon, caviar, everything bagel, and white asparagus - similar in texture to a traditional cheesecake, but savory4. Fluke marinated with daikon and sorrel - light and refreshing, similar to ceviche5. Lobster butter-poached with ginger and dandelion greens - one of my favorite courses; lobster was perfectly cooked and flavorful6. Snails grilled with morels and ramps - the presentation of this was really entertaining, as the snails were on kebab sticks and cooked at the table in a large fire; flavorful combination of snails and mushrooms7. Lamb with fava bean relish and nepitella - this was a bit of a disappointment, as the lamb tasted overcooked / old; the other option was duck, which my friend got--I tried a bite of that and it was pretty good8. Mustard greens with garlic and horseradish and snow peas with goat cheese and lemon - tasty accompaniments to our main courses 9. Goat cheese variations with rhubarb chutney - I didn't particularly like this course, as it wasn't quite sweet enough to feel like a dessert and the texture was a bit mushy10. Chocolate with milk ice cream and shortbread - rich and sweet; the chocolate was balanced out well by the milk ice cream11. Chocolate covered pretzel served with apple brandy - tasted like any other chocolate covered pretzel; the apple brandy was strong and aromatic; an entire bottle was served to us and we were told we could have as much as we liked (we both only had one serving though)While the food was good, I would hesitate to say it was worth $350.

119,2018-05-02,5.0,"A somewhat belated review of a truly memorable lunch experience in March.  This restaurant has been on my bucket list for a while, but every time I came to New York, I couldn't manage to get a table.  When I knew I would be coming for a conference, I booked a table for lunch, the only time available for my dates, months in advance.  I started calling all my NYC crew but no one was available to join me.  I cast my net further afield to Philly and Boston and one of my Boston friends answered the gastronomic call.  He had to take a bus and come in just for the day, but proclaimed it totally worth it.With three Michelin stars, and the title of the ""Best Restaurant in the World"", there was a lot of expectation going in to the Sunday lunch... On arrival, we were ushered into a cathedral-like space with soaring ceilings and an austere but welcoming Art Deco décor, mostly whites with touches of blue, including a truly spectacular large abstract painting on the far wall.  Seated in a cozy corner banquet, we were greeted like we were a combination of royalty and long lost friends by our servers.  The cocktail menu had several unusual combinations, I opted for one containing gin and horseradish among several other things.  After a few sips, I actually felt sad, as I knew I would never have another cocktail as good as this one.  It was everything I ever wanted in a cocktail and more.  The cocktail by which all other cocktails will be forever judged and found wanting.  On the pristine white tablecloth, there was an intriguing white box tied with string.  I assumed it would a parting gift to be taken home, but yay! we were allowed to open it right away.  Inside were two small savory black and white cheese cookies.  A delightful bite to kick off the meal. Our first course was the scallop, which was served raw with sea urchin.  Delightful and fresh.  The next dish was incredibly intricate and really showed off the subtle skills of the chef, the caviar with smoked ham and hollandaise, a sort of deconstructed eggs benedict.  There was a lot going on with this dish but it all came together in a very sophisticated way.  There were multiple other courses, which I could go on about for great length, but one does run out of superlatives after a while. I do need to note the mushroom tart which was another beautifully presented and complex dish, and the duck, glazed with honey and lavender.  We were offered a choice of three desserts, and each chose one, but then they brought us one of each so we got to try them all. Last on offer was a chocolate covered pretzel, brought with a bottle of apple brandy.  We were invited to have as much brandy as we wanted.  Alas, after that cocktail (did I mention the cocktails are really good?) and a few excellent wines by the glass, we only managed a few sips of the brandy, with having to navigate LaGuardia airport in just a few short hours.  And there was a parting gift!  A glass container of granola to have for breakfast the following morning (which I did, and it was amazing).Did it live up to the hype?  Definitely.  Was it the best meal I have ever had?  Certainly I would say this was the most flawless meal in terms of presentation, quality and service I have experienced.  Literally I cannot find anything to nit pick.  The bathrooms were a little boring maybe?  I would rate this as one of the top five dining experiences ever and it will certainly always be a memorable meal.  I can't wait to come back for dinner.

The duck breast, for example, was perfectly cooked but had an overly salty crust. The seared pate was perfect but the terrine version clashed with an underlying berry layer.

Staff was beyond friendly (although we did feel no one was over 23-27 years old working there, and wondered why), service was pretty attentive, sleek decor, and an overall lovely evening (still a very nice memorable celebration).  But I do not put this restaurant at the #1 in the world slot. And don't get how they have 3 Michelin stars. One thing that I hated was that it felt like a culinary school at all times with the kitchen making almost the exact same thing for every single table. You had a couple of options to choose from on the fixed menu told to you verbally, but it still felt like a school to me (us). When we went to Brooklyn Fare ages ago for their then 24 course tasting with all 18 guests, it felt like a private dinner party where they thoughtfully created colorful, visual dishes and tastebud masterpieces. But here to be in a large restaurant with everyone basically having the same thing here, it lost something with it and it felt redundant like a school. The food was good, but I (we) didn't feel it surprised or blew us away. We didn't sense real creativity to it to warrant the level they claim to be. Mind you, we hate foams and too creative over the top annoying dishes, but we felt it lacked elegant upscale creative culinary expertise. We wished for mind blowing wow factors as each course came out, but never got it. Again, it was very nice, but just didn't blow us away. We've had very simple that's blown us away, and we never saw that during this meal either. Le Bernardin is definitely still our favorite, and we are happy we dined here again since the reno, but I don't think we'd come back.We were very happy to have the kitchen tour, but we watched them escort in almost every table.

156,2018-03-05,4.0,"So this restaurant is definitely up there in my top restaurants, but I would by no means call it #1. -The first bite was a cross between a miniature black and white cookie and a ritz cracker cheese sandwich- nothing special to be honest.-The scallop course next with live diver scallop and sea urchin was wonderful- so fresh and light with the uni not overpowering the dish at all. And it worked so well with the sparkling pinot from Burgundy. The bread and broth with scallop infused butter on the side was another meh for me.-The sparkling pinot also worked well with the next dish- the play on eggs benedict with sturgeon caviar. A solid dish highlighted by the smoked ham with the caviar for me- they also provided miniature buns so you could create an egg mcmuffin sandwich of your own- very fun.-Then they invited me back to the kitchen- very similar to the French Laundry and such a nice touch. There they prepared another bite in front of me- chimney bread with black truffles done in a relish, cream, and a garnish. Again, a great touch, but it made me uncomfortable. When I eat something wonderful I like to eat slowly, chew thoughtfully and breathe a little, close my eyes, it's all very personal. And here I am standing at the station with people all around me and the server waiting to escort me back to my table, and honestly I couldn't really enjoy the dish. -Back at my table the next course was a definite wow for me- hudson valley foie gras with ginger, maple, and pickled apple paired with an amazing Cadillac (similar to a sauternes). I don't think I've ever taken as long to eat anything in my life, just couldn't bare to end it. The foie gras was perfect and the balance of the crisp pickled apple and the sweetness of the maple along with the Cadillac was just......I will be dreaming about this dish for quite awhile.-The butter-poached lobster was next and honestly the whole dish fell flat for me. I couldn't get past how chewy the lobster was for one, and the butternut squash and chestnut and kale just didn't add any warmth to me- they really didn't add much at all, though the sauce that was plated with it was delicious. Also, I'm not a big fan of Chablis to begin with and it was too bright and metallic for the dish I thought.-The mushroom tart was a table-side presentation and beautifully done- not to mention all the black truffle they shave over the crisp top. Over the top? Perhaps, but I loved it as someone who will never tire of all the truffle! In general though, I love mushrooms and this very pure mushroom dish was another highlight for me. I was excited about the Cabernet Franc from the Loire region as well (also as someone who loves Virginia/Maryland Cab Franc). It was definitely WAY more tannic than I was expecting and not something I could drink alone, but it did pair wonderfully with mushrooms and really brought out the funk in a good way.-The duck dish was...disappointing, but not because of the flavors. I love dry-aging and the peppercorn and lavender crust was mindblowingly good. But. When the dish came out the first time, the duck was a bit well-done for my liking and after I had talked to my server about the lobster, they told me to please let them know if I wanted anything done differently, and they were very sweet about it. So I had them take it back and the duck that came back out was seared on top but raw the rest of the way- which was perfect for the thinner end of the cut. But once I got up to the thickest part, I honestly had to cut away some of the uncooked part because it was just too raw for me and I felt really bad having them take it back a second time. It was honestly a little frustrating to know just how amazing this dish would have been if the duck was cooked properly throughout- maybe not have such a variation of thickness within the cut to keep from the inconsistent cooking? Overlooking that, the potato and the leek dumplings were good and the 2005 Nebbiolo from Piedmont was perfect with this dish. I've never had a more divine-smelling wine too, just smelling the beautiful mix of earthy cherry and floral (lavender?) easily passed the time while I was waiting for the duck .-It was fun to get a completely different preparation of a Nebbiolo from 2016 to compare with the last glass for the cheese course. The alpine cheese with celery root was wonderful and worked so well with this sweeter, more acidic Nebbiolo. The winter greens tossed in a black truffle dressing were a throw away for sure though and added nothing to the dish.-Another oh wow was the pumpkin cake with bruleed butternut squash, butternut squash and yuzu ice cream with sarsaparilla. Such an amazing blend of gentle sweetness, salty and savory and then the acid of the yuzu just cuts it so well. The sweet Ramandolo complimented every bite, especially since the dessert itself was not very sweet to begin with.

Food just simply wasn't as good as other top tier restaurants such as French Laundry, Alinea, and even Chez Panisse.  For $300+ per lunch (without drinks), you expect some mind-blowing taste!I think it was a total of 12 courses?First came out some little savory cheese cookies and a delicious scallop broth.   The broth was actually one of our favorite items!  Very flavorful.  Perfect salt level.  Cookies were okay, but I didn't eat them to save room for the main event.  Scallop with sea urchin - delicious.  We enjoyed this light and refreshing dish.  I think there were some thin apple slices in it?  It was an appropriate appetizer.  Caviar - this is a take on Eggs Benedict with ham gelée, hollandaise custard, and sturgeon caviar.  Oh and a poached egg.  Very good.  Nothing particularly special except the container is beautiful.  Squid - this was good...   again, something you'd have at any good sushi restaurant.  Chopped up squid and horseradish and juniper.   We enjoyed it.  Foie gras - delicious.   simple sear.   But we were already starting to feel like the foods were too rich.  I didn't finish this item because I knew I couldn't get through the rest of the courses.  Lobster - good.  A few classic bites that are butter poached.  Halibut - I thought this was better than the lobster!   The cabbage on the side was awesome, warming, and perfectly seasoned.  The turnip on top was very flavorful and perfectly shaped like little fish scales.  Mushroom Tart - delicious broth and i loved the mushrooms!   But at this point, we're getting full and even though they put probably $400 worth of truffles on our food it's like...  what's the point?  They tasted earthy but that's about it.  Just some dry truffle shavings on a cracker...  didn't do it for me.    Venison - this is a take on a Beef Wellington and again while good, nothing to write home about.  More foie gras.  Actually getting tired of foie gras and truffles at this point.  How is that even possible?Duck with Cabbage -  this is actually featured in the Eleven cookbook - it's a beauty with lavender and Szechuan peppercorns on top.  They went a bit too far with the dry-roasted seasonings on top I think.   I don't really want to be biting through whole peppercorns and such but it does look nice.  Is it the best duck I've ever had?  No.  Trip to the kitchen -  so apparently if you ask you can visit the kitchen and see the amazing working they do back there...  plus they make you a great bite with (more) black truffle made into a mousse and piped into a cornet.  Kind of like the cone that they have at French Laundry.  I guess this is an homage to that.  It's okay but I didn't bother finishing it.  Too full and the black truffles were not flavorful no offense.  Tubby cheese -  at this point we're sick of eating, so I don't even remember this.  I think it was good.  It came with a mediocre dressed salad.  Chocolate Tuile with Creme Fraiche ice cream - good.  Don't know what else to say.  Pear Cranberry Donut with Mulled Wine Ice cream - okay so this donut is AWFUL.  I don't know who came up with this weird sour donut but it's gross.  but, the ice cream on the side is delicious!  I don't even like or eat dessert and I could bathe in this stuff man!Apple Brandy and pretzel chocolates -  oh so they bring you a whole bottle of brandy at the end and you can stay and drink as much as you like...

168,2018-02-11,1.0,"Well, what can I say... Michelin Guide is very misguided in their 3 star rating for this mess of what some call ""the worlds best restaurant"".   We've been to many fine dining places in the city, including Daniels, Jean Georges, Per Se, and Masa to name a few, so it was good feel the caliber of this place in comparison to their competitors.We had a reservation for 2 for dinner and arrived about 20 minutes early.  Upon entering, we were quickly approach by an uncomfortably high strung woman who's energy seemed a bit too invasive for a high class restaurant.Since we came a bit early, we were guided to a waiting area with 2 chairs right in the unsightly intersection of the hallway, bathrooms, coat check and second floor stairway, basically the busiest cross section of the place with groups of people constantly lining up with their rears toward you as they wait for their coats, bathroom, etc.  Totally uncomfortable, noisy, and hectic place to sit customers for the waiting area.  Once they finally realized the chaos we were placed in, someone came, apologized and took us to our table.  At this point, we were tense, uncomfortable and definitely not in a fine dining mood.As we were seated, we were given a wine list that is as thick as an encyclopedia, and a pleasant woman came to discuss the best wines for our taste, this went pretty well.While waiting for our wine, a careless waiter serving the table next to us knocked over a patrons' cell phone on the floor.When our waiter came, he told us the menu items and we had to choose right there what we wanted (we were never given a menu to look at), but had to choose on the spot while he stood there and mentioned their items.  This made everything seem rushed and pressured.  To add further, as soon as the waiter took our order, he tells us he will take our desert order later, creating further feelings of being rushed somewhere.At this point, we're happy to see our wine being poured so we can finally take a little breather from all this mess.   I won't get into minute detail, but the presentation of dishes was very lackluster (dark, grey, bland colors, no pizzaz), the flavors were overpowering each other  (e.g. truffle dish was overpowered by the hollandaise sauce it was mixed with, the caviar in another dish was overpowered by the smoked/salty fish cream).  By the way, these dishes were served in Tin Cans!, similar to the ones supermarket sardines would be placed in.  This is supposed to give a sense of freshness eh?   As I was eating the warm bread bun with butter over a small plate, one busgirl just pushes my plate aside from under me, mid-bite, and puts another dish in front of me.  I almost choked.Another absurd dish I was served was essentially a small piece of toasted rye bread with bitter tasting lettuce on top and some salad dressing type sauce.  At this point I'm realizing that the joke's on us.  You're kidding me with lettuce on toast right? It gets better... I am then served some kind of pancake looking dish that is elegantly called ""Beluga Lentils"", it's just beans compressed together with potatoes and garlic.  The main course, which was duck, was cooked OK, but the meat was chewy and bland.The only half decent dish was the mushroom tart with crimini and truffle mushrooms.We must have had 5 or 6 different busboys/girls come to our table throughout the night, most were trying to please, but unfortunately, this created a sense of constant distraction with so many different people coming and talking to you.  When the crumbs were being wiped from our table, some were spilled on me and hit my hand and pants.For desert, I had a pear-cranberry donut, that's right a freakin donut.  Although not bad tasting for a diner perhaps, this is not acceptable for such a restaurant.   Although we were not finished with desserts, our main waiter took it from our table without asking if we were finished, making us feel like he wanted us to leave quicker as this was already 12:20am.The decor inside is bland, boring, colorless, no flowers or any soul...  staff is also dressed in gray.  I thought these guys just renovated?   Anyway, we were completely blown away by the failures on all levels in this restaurant and totally didn't expect this from a 3 star michelin restaurant.  After doing some research on Michelin, we realized it's all a farce, see this Vanity Fair Review of Michelin's approach, it put everything into perspective for us:https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/11/whats-wrong-with-the-michelin-guideProbably this place would have more 1 star reviews if people didn't mind re-living their bad experiences and writing them here, but most probably avoid doing.",0.0926582080200501,845,9.135365853658536,-41.89527217860086

We were seated at a table at the corner of the room, sitting at two corners facing the entire room. I know this may be a matter of preference but it was quite uncomfortable facing all the other diners sitting in the room. As we sat down, we noticed a bunch of wrapped gifts in the middle of the table. Then, we sat waiting....watching the waitstaff walking back and forth and watching the other diners eat. It may have only been a few minutes but, it felt awkwardly long before someone approached us to let us know that our first course was in the presents and they needed to be unwrapped. Quirky fun presentation but, just aggravating that we waited so long. Moving on, I am used to having either a set menu or ordering a la carte at a Michelin.

I did note tables unused for the duration of our meal and wonder if popularity is flagging.  We'll go back...soon.",0.2899999999999999,140,-1.0115384615384617,13.992916974547143
187,2018-01-20,5.0,"Eleven Madison Park was nothing short of magical. The price may be a pain point for some (especially if you're opting for the wine pairings), but when you're devouring course after course, the rest of the world comes to a complete halt, and nothing else matters. You sit there, a fork in one hand and a knife in the other, with an expression that can only be described as a stupid, dumbfounded grin. Because in that moment, you are not the you who strolls down Fifth Avenue with shopping bags in hand, or the you who takes trips to Europe to eat the best of what chefs around the world have to offer, or even the you who works tirelessly to scrape up enough disposable income to treat yourself to a night out here. In that moment, you are part of the EMP family, and you will unquestionably be treated as such from the second you step into their doors.To get some of the logistics out of the way, I came here on a Friday night at 6:15PM with my mom to celebrate her birthday. I called ahead of time to let the restaurant know the special occasion, in addition to my aversion to cheese. Along with the tasting menu, we opted for the wine pairings, along with a table-side brewing of the High Mountain Oolong tea at the end of the meal. In total, the food came out to $642 and change, and the beverages an additional $406.Overall, I just wanted to share my thoughts on a few different points:1. Wine PairingsWhile I enjoyed the wine pairings, if I were to return, I don't think I'd be getting it again. The wines were interesting, and they definitely paired well with the food that was presented, but ultimately, I don't think the varieties we were served justified the high cost. A vast majority of the wines were French - not really an issue, just something to keep in mind if you're not the biggest fan of wines that taste earthy and heavily reflect the terroir of where the grapes were grown.2. Prolonging the EMP ExperienceAt the conclusion of the meal, the restaurant gifted us a bag filled with a jar of house-made granola from that morning, along with a cleverly designed menu of all the courses we tasted that night. The menu itself is folded in the same tin can that the caviar course was presented in, and was a nice touch compared to the plain paper menus that were handed out in the past. In addition, for my mom's birthday, they also included a large chocolate bar in her bag that she has yet to taste.3. Table-side teaAt first, I didn't think the $24 price tag on a table-side experience would be worth whatever EMP had in store. Thankfully, I was proven wrong, and I actually learned a great deal about the restaurant's philosophies in brewing both tea and coffee, along with some of the science and art behind a great cup of brewed tea. The Gaiwan set they used looked and felt amazing in its pure simplicity, and the tea sommelier was kind enough to provide an extra steeping of the Oolong as well.4. FoodTo quickly touch on the courses we were served that night:* Black and White Cookie with Cheddar and Apple - B* Scallops with Sea Urchin, Scallop Butter, and Scallop Broth - A+* Caviar Eggs Benedict with Smoked Ham and Sturgeon - A+* Foie Gras marinated with Squash and Pumpkin Seeds - A+* Poached Halibut with Turnip - A* Mushroom Tart with Cremini and Black Truffle & Portobello - A+* Venison un Croute with Foie Gras and Civet - B* Roasted Carrot with Buckwheat and Mustard - B+* Baked Potato with Horseradish and Bacon - B+* (Instead of Grilled Cheese) Chocolate Tuile with Creme Fraiche Ice Cream and Cranberry - A-* Pear-Cranberry Donut with Mulled Wine Ice Cream - A* Chocolate Covered Pretzel & Apple Brandy - A-While EMP didn't wow us with an impeccable menu suited to our exact taste buds course after course, overall, we had a sublime evening. The granola they sent us home with is fantastic, and I'm still very happy about the fact that we got to bring home the tin can with the EMP insignia branded on the top - I actually considered just taking it during the caviar course but decided against it.Reservations may be difficult to come by and try for, and the price tag may be even more difficult to justify, but given the chance, I would do it all again in a heartbeat.

189,2018-01-17,5.0,"I'm not sure what there is to say that's not already been said. Eleven Madison Park was a superb dining experience. There's a reason it's consistently showered with awards and placed on prestigious list after prestigious list. Things here are done so impeccably, so pristinely, it almost felt too composed. The amount of preparation that so clearly goes into every aspect of the EMP experience is truly remarkable. The menu, the service, the wine pairings--all choreographed and executed to perfection. I suppose one should expect this considering the price tag on a meal here. But you never really know until you try. And try, we did. My boyfriend--the best there is and ever was--got us a reservation here for my birthday. I'm a big-time foodie, but not the type you'll find at Michelin spots. I like to splurge when I dine out, but there's a line and places like the EMPs, Per Ses and Le Bernadines of the world are far beyond what I'm willing/able to pay. So this was just all kinds of special. Now, this point is important because I don't have any similar experiences to compare our night at EMP to. We've never done a long tasting menu before and we've only done a handful of prix fixe nights out. But I've had the pleasure of eating at a lot of really really good restaurants in NYC, so I'd like to think my two cents is still worth something. So we arrived here for our 8:45 reservation and walked into splendor. Coats were taken and we were delivered to our seats. We opted for the standard wine pairing, which is $175/pp. If you're going to drink and are a fan of wine, I think this is probably your best option. It's expensive, but the alcohol on the menu here is just wildly expensive--even the half-bottles (try to keep in mind that I'm a millennial with a modest salary who has a hobby that she really has no business trying to afford)--so the pairing made the most sense for us. And it was delicious. My boyfriend and I ordered different dishes when the option was available to try as many dishes as possible, which meant we got to sample a wonderful variety of wines as well. The only instance in which I'd recommend going with a bottle or half-bottle (or cocktails) is if you're a lightweight/aren't a huge drinker. I think the pairing amounts to about 4-5 glasses of wine, which might be a serious undertaking for some. That said, the meal does last 3+ hours so the alcohol intake is somewhat moderated. When I review restaurants, I tend to list the dishes we try and grade each one. We had a nine-course meal at EMP, so it would be hopeless (for the sheer reason that I'd run out of characters almost immediately, a roadblock I face virtually every time I write a review on here). I'll list what we received here but give some more general commentary/give little shoutouts to the highlights. All listed chronologically to give an idea of flow:*Apple / Cheddar Black and White Cookie: A+*Scallop Live with Sea Urchin, Scallop Butter and Broth: A+*Caviar Benedict with Smoked Ham, Sturgeon, and Hollandaise, served w/ mini English Muffins: A++Squid grilled w/ Juniper and Horseradish: A+Foie Gras Seared w/ Maple and Apple: A++Lobster butter-poached w/ Butternut Squash and Chestnut: A++Halibut poached w/ variations of Turnip: A*Mushroom Tarte w/ Crimini and Black Truffle: A++*Crimini and Portobello served w/ mains: AHoney and Lavender-glazed Duck w/ Cabbage: A+*Potato baked w/ Horseradish and Bacon: A*Leek w/ roasted Hazelnut and Parmesan: AVenison en Croute w/ Fois Gras and Civet: A+*Cheese tart: A+Pear Donut: A+Chocolate-covered Pretzels* = both receivedThe only real surprise with everything here was the presentation/aesthetics. Nothing was particularly colorful or fancy. Quite simple, superficially, far more complex when you take a bite. I don't know if that's intentional on EMP's part, but it was almost peculiar. That's hardly a gripe though, everything was just delicious and brought out at the perfect pace. The wine pairings were delightful, thoughtful and certainly enhanced the consumption experience. Highlights/notes:-The black and white cookie was as a mind-f*** and a tasty one at that-Everyone should wrap their uni in a live scallop blanket -Hard to get more decadent than caviar eggs benedict and my god, I have never tried to take a longer time eating something-You will never insult squid again by ordering it fried after having this squid preparation-I said that thing about decadence with the eggs benny but I maybe already changed my mind because that foie gras knocked me over-The best entertainment out there is watching someone shave truffle over something you're about to eat and then eating that something with pride-Duck can be big, ugly, messy and tasty or elegant, refined, clean and tasty. I love duck. Duck is tasty. This duck was as good as it gets. -I don't like donuts but I loved this donut. What else is new?-Gold pretzels.

192,2018-01-12,1.0,"Wow, what a night, I  left the restaurant shocked and amazed, not about how good they are of course, but  about How can that possibly be a Michelin 3 star restaurant!!? I literally took a day to process why Eleven Madison Park was named the Best Restaurant in the world for 2017. My conclusion is maybe that title put them at so much pressure that they have decided to go low key for this year's new tasting menu. I am just out of luck that I went in a few days too late for their previous tasting menu. My night was ruined after 3 long hours of bland unappetizing food.  I'm visiting from LA with my boyfriend and we already dined at Per Se,  Le Bernadine, Jean Georges, the river cafe, and a couple other Michelin restaurants before our dinner here at EMP, of course we had to stop here before going back to LA in a couple days. We are both huge foodies and dine out everyday, and we do know how to properly appreciate food. I tried so hard to love EMP, I really did, but I just can't:(  I rarely write reviews about restaurants on Yelp because I usually don't have too strong of a feeling towards them, So EMP really struck a nerve for me. I even called the manager at EMP Billy to help me understand why their new menu is the way it is. All I got was ""they do thrive for simplicity there so the food both taste good and really focuses on that ingredient alone. "" Nothing else. okay, this is where it all went wrong. There is nothing wrong with that concept except EMP FAILED at EVERY ASPECT OF THAT CONCEPT!!!!! Sure the dishes were simple, but it was visually unappetizing and tasted flavorless and uninteresting. I don't expect every dish to be plated beautifully like how most of the fine dining restaurants like to do, but I do expect every dish to taste delicious. I can't believe they could ruin foie gras and truffle for me. The seared foie gras tasted like pork fat, me and my boyfriend both agreed unanimously. The lobster was chewy, the venison was under seasoned and the foie gras wrapped in middle of it was unnecessary, the diced up squid was a joke, and it's pointless to go through and describe how every dish taste because they all fall under the same description: bland and unappetizing. The caviar dish was probably the only  dish that deserves a Michelin 3 star rating, and that dish was in previous tasting menus already. Service here was good, not really warm and welcome, just good. There was several times where we waited roughly 15 minutes for our dish to arrive, where we had nothing on the table and just sat there awkwardly sipping more and more wine.  There is also a no flash photography rule here:) all I wanted was a picture using my Polaroid. Not a flash photography of every dish. Sure is strict for a restaurant with no dress code. I am writing this to inform people do not come here at this time, maybe after they change their tasting menu again. Or else you will regret coming here and  be disappointed by ""The Best Restaurant in the world"" I honestly don't think they will keep this title till next year. Or maybe do go just so you can say you dined at the best restaurant in the world before that title goes to a far away restaurant you know?",0.08390425999121649,600,12.36,7.704157216829117

195,2018-01-10,4.0,"After looking forward to EMP, the ""world's best restaurant"" for a year, I finally got a chance to visit with a few coworkers.  EMP recently went through a massive renovation and was closed for a while and though I'm not sure what it looked like before, I can comment that the decor inside is not bright but not dim, clean, and fresh.  It's not the overly fancy kind of decor you'd expect from such a place, in my opinion.  Service was superb, as it should be for a place with this kind of reputation.  People were pulling out my chairs, replacing napkins, and always around.  We started off with gift boxes around our table for 6 which was strange, as I had expected real gifts and not food in them.. definitely a nice touch for the holiday season.  Inside there were a few starters/amuse bouche.  Given the menu changes all the time here, it's probably not too valuable to go into detail about everything.  The highlight of the starters was the caviar, though I wasn't too big of a fan of the play on bagels and cream cheese thing they did - seemed a little cheap if I dare say.For some of your dishes, you are given a choice of 1-3 options.  Next, I chose the cold foie gras, layered in between cabbage. Literally amazing.  I had the tilefish after that, which was very mustardy and kind of took away from the flavor of the flaky fish.  There was then a presentation of a pumpkin which sounds weird, but it was kind of cool.  They opened it up in front of you and then took it away and served the most melt in your mouth pumpkin with a light broth.  In between dishes, we got an (expensive?) bottle of wine and the sommelier did a really cool presentation where they basically melted off the neck of a wine bottle - would recommend this for anyone who feels bougie.Next was the most DELICIOUS piece of seared duck with Sichuan peppercorn ever.  Favorite dish of the night.  This rivals Momofuku Ko's duck which was one of my favorites also.There were a few little side dishes and what not, but nothing to call home about.  We got a play on pretzels, cheese and beer that I really wasn't a huge fan of, but everyone else loved it.For dessert, we all shared all the options except the cranberry one and they were all amazing, especially the apple cider donut.  At the end we also got ""chocolate pretzels"".All in all, a divine dining experience that everyone should absolutely do once, but I would not quite say this was the most amazing meal or dining experience of my life... I just wasn't blown away as I was expecting to be given EMP's rep, but it was still a damn good meal.",0.22636054421768703,490,-4.675,85.50140791193326

197,2017-12-26,2.0,"As many other foodies. if given a chance to experience the #1 restaurant in the world. you do it!. that said I've been to other Awesome stared Michelin restaurants, and this one was just a disappointment. big expectations, absolutely no delivery. All name, food didn't back it up!. First of all please understand that at no point would I call this a ""bad"" restaurant, the food is fancy enough, showy enough, and what I do believe they excel in (the service) is good enough. but kept on feeling cheated almost, as in if I was experiencing a restaurant that got to the top, and just gave up. I would even doubt that the head chef was at the helm that night, there was so many letdowns.To the good, you are received like they know you, there is no checking a list or even waiting (at the start) if you arrive on time you will be seated right away and handed over to a very capable waitress, a drink specialist, and another team member whose entire job seemed to be to set up the table and sweep it up when done (though even that stopped after the 4th course -  of an 8 course dinner). the drinks that were recommended where just plain outstanding (wine and a cocktail) so the bartender knows his stuff!...the restaurant is big, huge for new York standards  actually and nicely decorated for the holidays...  and that's where I'm going to have to stop the ""good"".To the not so good. granted we were there on the 20th of December, it was my Birthday and were celebrating our upcoming nuptials (all of which they remembered - and mentioned). after the redesign that they went through mid year I really thought they would have come up with a personal, awesome, romantic set up. nope. very few main tables (weird for a place that big) we were seated by some booths by the bar area, arms reach from the next two tables, and right by the entrance to the bathroom areas, it was very loud oh so loud, half the time you couldn't really hear the waiter when she nicely tried to explain the dishes in front of us. the color, the booth, the set up. really made me think of a Vegas all you can eat joint. lighting could have made it a bit better, but they decided on this yellow tint bulbs, I guess to make the place more romantic?. well when you mess up the rest, the noise, and you are so close to the next table, that you might as well call it family style dinning. dimming the lights to a darkish yellow, is just frustrating, because it makes all of the food they present you with, look gray and very unappetizing. To the food. again, not bad. yet again, doubt the main head chef (and owner now I guess) was there, the food is minimalistic, which is to be expected when you go for an 8 course menu, definitely more leaning to French than American. that said if I was to call the main ingredient of the night, I would say it was SALT. they go heavy on the salt on everything. the bread rolls have salt (and sea salt to the side), every dish is Salt heavy, even the desert (ice cream) had sea salt sprinkled over it. now I got absolutely nothing against salt. if anything my fiancé is the one that was suffering because she does hate salt heavy dishes, but this was extreme and completely unbalanced, there was nothing in the plate to run to in order to tune it down. no acid, no butter sauce. just salty stuff packed over salty stuff. there were some dishes that reminded me that we were at a fancy restaurant (like the duck - I thought it was good enough for a great French spot - absolutely not good enough for Michelin). but then there were others that just left me feeling cheated. a mushroom dish that was nothing that a huge mushroom on the dish with some type of sauce. again I LOVE Mushrooms. but when you see a dish consisting of just one thing, you expected to blow your mind. nope. together with the lighting (which made it look like a weird brown blob on the dish, it tasted like nothing. really nothing. no explosion of flavor. no awesome taste of mushroom. just tasted like a mushroom soaked in beef stock (not even, maybe vegie stock). the initial offering of caviar and an assortment of little jars of jellies. was just that. tasted like canned stuff.again not bad. but THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD!! I don't expect to taste canned food!. caviar was good. but so tamed that all I tasted was the cream cheese under it actually... then came a pate dish. that was just one big slice of pate. I guess we were expected to eat it with the salty rolls, but since they came at different times and there was no good explanation of the dish left me to try the pate on its own. big mistake!. flavorless!. it tasked like eating butter. but not good butter. again, I like pate and love French food. this was neither.  The duck dish was ok, but there was barely any on the plate, same with the veal. barely any there and what was there was flavorless paired with a Salty sauce.At the end for $700+... for a dinner for two... this was not close to worth it. $50 a plate I would be closer",0.09792889782175497,944,-16.695833333333336,3.016018579140109

We got here on a Wednesday evening for a 9 pm reservation. It was my birthday so I thought what better place to have dinner than EMP. We were greeted at the door by their very courteous and professional staff , seated in the lounge till our table was ready and started off with our drinks. Cranberry cocktail was very refreshing even on a cold night and the Sauv was crisp and fruity , great selection. We were seated at our table in 15 minutes and our first course that included Caviar , Beet with trout roe , cucumber with pumpernickel & salmon , potato with quail egg & mustard and Mackerel wit fennel & salmon was adjust served in gift boxes - a perfect gesture to a birthday celebration. We opened the boxes and found all these treats. It was served with everything bagel and crackers , this was a great way to start and I told myself this is totally worth all the wait. Everything mentioned above was delicious especially potato with quail egg and the caviar. It was fresh and full of flavour. My taste buds felt they were in wizard of oz. Foie Gras with cabbage and apple follows next. I have had Foie Gras all the way from Beijing to LA and I felt it did not keep up with the way things started , the flavour was dull and didn't quite hold itself. Next was Tilefish with parsnip and pike roe. I was excited for the tilefish until I was not. The parsnip and pike roe sounded it would go perfect with tilefish but again the flavour fell short. I felt they just did not blend well together and the flavour fell flat. Following the tilefish was pumpkin roasted with seaweed and bacon. It was brought to the table and cut in front of us. It smelt delicious and once presented to us with pork broth an absolute delight to eat. The flavour was perfect and the aroma just added to the texture and taste. The main entree succeeded the pumpkin. I had the duck that is aged for 3 weeks glazed with honey , lavender and apple. I like duck because of the savoury flavour it carries usually. The glazing is the craftsmanship of a genius but disappointingly the duck was dried out a little more than normal which made it like any other protein just hard and deprived of its flavour. It was served with kale with pearl onion and potato confit to share which were both very decent.   My favourite part of every meal to end the dinner - dessert. I had apple cider doughnut with cinnamon ice cream , you can never go wrong with that. Very well done. Finally a masterly crafted chocolate covered pretzel which cleansed the palate pretty well. Dessert I felt was average but at EMP I guess I wasn't expecting average. The berry combination that my friend had was actually very delicious and something you'd expect at a place like this. We were brought a bottle of signature of EMP apple brandy to sip , on the house and it was pretty solid. If I already hadn't had 3 glasses of wine I would've definitely enjoyed it more. To wrap up the evening we were brought a small bag to take home which had our menu folded in a tiny box along with some granola. A very beautiful gesture and elegantly presented. To summarise , the staff went above and beyond , very pleasant and accommodating. The food was good overall but when at a place like this or at the best restaurant in the world you expect something much better than you can find elsewhere. I was a little bit disappointed but as I said in the beginning maybe I just had too high of expectations. I compared it Oriole which I felt surpassed them in flavour.

201,2017-12-17,4.0,"EMP has always been held in high regard by any food lover -- and even so much more after being named #1 in the world for 2017.  I liked the ambiance as it was not too dark or quiet.  The service was amazing as to be expected.  Much thought was given to the presentation of the food too.  This creativity was shown from the second we sat down.  The first course was a surprise -- caviar and accompaniments hidden in wrapped boxes, waiting to be open.  We really enjoyed the presentation and the caviar proved to be one of our favorite courses.  The rest of the food, however, did not really live up to hype.  I wished the creativity carried over to the flavors of the remaining dishes.

If I was rating this restaurant based on service alone, it would easily be a 5 star. However, factoring in the food, it brought it down to a 3. There was simply no single dish that blew me away. We had to make reservations as soon as it was available, and even then, we had to settle for the 9:45PM slot. Everything from the atmosphere to the service to the opening presentation was great. However, when the food started to arrive, the disappointment started to set in. There were a few good dishes, don't get me wrong (foie gras, duck, berry dessert). I just did not feel like it was up to my standards. Maybe I walked in with such high standards given its reputation, but I left wanting more. If you got the wine pairing, they gave you a kitchen tour, so that was a cool touch.They gave us the menu and a jar of granola as a takeaway, which was cool as a keepsake.

To clarify, we are recent transplants in NYC so we try the tick down the list, but we have done visits mostly internationally. Let me leave the guessing out - if Pete Wells of the New York Times was visiting Eleven Madison tonight (Nov. 23rd), his review would have likely sent a shock-wave throughout the world of fine dining.  I'll leave the food out, for the most part, as one can say it was Thanksgiving so the chef clearly just phoned it in. No creativity whatsoever, bland taste and very little flavor. Instead, i'll focus on the service, but circle back to the food later. The service was awful. I wish there was another way to put it but from start to finish, it was just not good. I don't want to bore anyone with play-by-play so here are the highlights: cocktail glass and wine glass empty without being asked to refill or alternative. Server couldn't answer questions about the gluten free bread my wife was having. Very little check in throughout the meal, rushed service and very impersonal and lastly it took more than 5 minutes to find our coats as we were leaving. I must address the food after all. No Amuse-bouche, absolutely no accommodation to gluten free - my wife's dessert was a joke of 12 berries put together, super small portions, only 3 courses, no cheese or after dinner cocktail offering and then again very bland food. Overall, felt very rushed and that no one from the staff really wanted to be there. For the $300/pp price tag, it was a complete rip off.

220,2017-11-09,3.0,"Have you ever walked away from a restaurant disappointed and wanting a ""do over meal"" from somewhere that's actually good?  That was me. My review is probably harsh and nitpicky but I can list other restaurants that have outdone EMP in different areas. 4 star service - wait staffs were attentive but they fell short personalization and synchronization.A)    Personalization - before arriving, EMP contacts you to see if it's a special occasion, if you have any food allergies or dietary restrictions.  We went there for our anniversary and not that I am looking for complimentary toast or dessert but no one mentioned or congratulated us on our anniversary.  That was a minor miss.  The bigger misses were in the beginning.  The wait staff asked again if we had any food allergies or food aversion.  We said no.  But the survey was already taken the day before so it would be nice for the staff to reconfirm our answer rather than re-asking the same question we already answered. B)    Synchronization - this is an observation on the party of 6 table in front of us where plates were not served in sync.  It was a table of 3 ladies and 3 gentlemen with 3 wait staff serving.  The plates came out the same time but placing it on the table was off and at one point a gentleman was served first before the plate was served to the lady (Big Gasp right?!?).  This SUPER nitpicky but I always remember how well Del Posto executed their plate-serving synchronization when we went as a group of 5.3 star food/menu - there were no physical menus presented but the server spoke about the options.  I personally appreciate visually seeing what's on the menu and the components in the dish so I can be more engaged with my dishes incase I have questions on the ingredients.  The food itself was good but it was nothing mind blowing except for the caviar dish for me.  That was amazing!  The food in general was good but not memorable.  It was bland and maybe it's the menu served that day but it's missing complexity.  That especially goes for the lobster dish which is essentially the tail plus some bisque which by the way my husband had a piece of shell on his dish. The presentation was lacking.  Same plates were used throughout the meal and nothing creative with plating.  Our wine pairing glasses had more character than the plates.  Per Se definitely takes the cake in everything but especially in presentation.  One negative note on the food is the duck.  I'm a huge duck fan and whenever that's an option on the menu, that would be my go to.  I felt mine was overcooked and had to send it back for a more medium/pink center one.  The replacement one came and it was still over cooked to the point where it was super hard for me to cut with the smooth edge knife they served it with.  I felt a serrated knife would be a more proper utensil pairing but they did not have any in the restaurant. 4 star cocktail drinks - drinks were good and good presentation but of course it doesn't compare drinks at Flatiron Room, Raines Law Room, etc. 3 star ambiance/décor - the space is big and open with very high ceilings with a modern look but it's not warm, engaging or stimulating.  For a good ambiance décor restaurant, Daniel would be the top contender for me.",0.1751003401360544,594,4.116,31.357216813629293

Unfortunately I eat everything and I'm not a picky difficult person so I couldn't benefit personally from that level of accommodation they definitely excel at. Bottom line: they need to rethink their tasting menu because if you're #1, you can't have ok dishes. The dishes were just ok. Nothing amazing. Everyone I was with agreed.

225,2017-10-30,4.0,"I came to EMP on my first trip to NYC, to celebrate many occasions (two birthdays and an anniversary to be exact)! We had been following the remodel of EMP and were really looking forward to our meal. We left very satiated with no regrets. The ultimate takeaway of our experience was that for the cost, it was worth it, but only for a nice occasion. Would I necessarily be able to justify the high cost for just an average night - absolutely not. And for the high cost, was everything done impeccably? Close, but not quite. I've had equally great food at a lower price point (eg, $150 pp vs $300 pp), but where EMP really sets itself above the rest is service. There was never a moment that we felt forgotten about. Napkins were folded, surfaces cleaned, shawls were delivered (for us perpetually shivering ladies!), and tablecloths were ironed (literally!). In terms of the food, at that cost and at 3 Michelin stars, I really expected to be WOW'd by every single dish. Unfortunately, this was just not the case. STANDOUTS: - Starter bites: compressed apples dipped in foie gras caramel with apple almond crumble. Who would have known that tart apple and the sweetness of the caramel could be so well complimented by smooth and rich foie gras?! - Smoked sturgeon cheesecake with caviar: this one was communally served and an absolute showstopper! it tasted like an ultra luxurious bagel with lox and looked a million bucks. Could have taken it without the pickled cucumbers. - Seared warm foie gras dish with beets: This course was presented with various other options (clams with fennel, mushroom carpaccio, or the cold foie gras preparation with cabbage). I ended up choosing the clams, but this to me was the CLEAR winner. I would try to explain all the components of the dish, but frankly I am not sure (aside from the beets, there was a crunch component), and it was just indescribable. This is hands down one of the best things I've ever tasted! - Roasted duck with honey and lavender: beautiful and impeccably executed from head to toe. The duck with succulent and juicy and the crusted skin with salt and honey provided just the right amount of texture to the dish. COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT:- Starter bites: sweet potato tart. They compared it to a sweet potato pie when describing to us, but honestly it was a very sad, black sheep version. I feel like there are so many better things that can be done with a sweet potato. - Clams with fennel: while visually beautiful and labor intensive, I just found the taste to be one note: surfer clams, with clam mouse, and dill. It felt like it was missing something and it was not the most pleasing texture. - Kale seasonal side with egg yolk: There was something underneath the kale (perhaps a kale puree) that was a very deep green color with a bitter taste and displeasing texture. Honestly, I wasn't sure what it was and it was the only thing we ate all night that was left on the plate. - Wine pairings: Unfortunately, we were not impressed by a majority of the pairings chosen and would probably do without this the next time around. For the experience as a whole (food, service, kitchen tour), we had a great night. But for the overall bill, it just felt like there were certain areas that could have been improved. For $300 a person, I think the kabocha squash course and cheddar with pretzel and beer could be improved/elevated (lovely, just not something I would expect at this pricepoint). However, the personalization and take home gifts were certainly nice touches and I would absolutely recommend EMP to everyone looking to have a nice night out.",0.19644165516448123,636,5.179310344827585,66.61480523451792

229,2017-10-27,1.0,"Thoroughly unimpressed.  The service was attentive and overall good.   Following that, and a sturgeon / caviar savory cheesecake, there were few highlights.  Long wait for a drink to start the meal, starters were ok, a bit bland or ""one note"".  The lobster was chewy and lacked flavor.  Veal loin was chewy, almost rubbery and also lacked flavor.  It's unfortunate - we had high hopes, but it looks like EMP has jumped the shark as they say....",0.08433333333333334,75,3.4153846153846152,-0.024794090659042922
230,2017-10-26,2.0,"Overall very disappointing. when you wait at the bar they give you their snacks ( olives, potato chips, and nuts... ) really? at the number 1 restaurant in the world? we could not believe it.Then we sat and we got the same white and black cockies that they always gave you. ( you also use to finished with that, now they skipped) then we wait for 20 minutes to get the snack, that honestly had nothing to impress. neither say we were expecting much more for being the number one of the best 50.then nothing was really wow, the duck now they dont even sow it to you. we just got the breast. we had much better experience before the renovation 2 years ago.agree with some reviews ... the cheese plate is heavy, and too big for us. none on the table had more than one bite.deserts were all just ok.the waiting between courses was extremely long. and we all got really bored.   Sorry but EMD didn't met our expectations at all....  honestly made us feel  that all this awards and stars and  press and etc etc its all BU&%$!!#@IT!!!!",0.12240740740740742,193,3.8083333333333336,-2.535023055539341

The space is gorgeous (the new bar area is a big improvement from how it used to be), the service is wonderful and the presentation of the food is amazing.  A couple of the dishes were fantastic (the cheesecake with sturgeon  and caviar and the pretzel with cheddar cheese, mustard and beer) but the rest were just okay.  For the reputation of this restaurant, I expected better.  I have dined here 3 or 4 times in the past 10 years and all of those past times were much better.",0.31136363636363634,96,16.502564102564097,32.048939894259775
232,2017-10-22,5.0,"Impeccable dining experience at the world no. 1 restaurant! It reopened recently after closing down for renovation for 4 months. There's no menu given but the knowledgeable staff will guide you through the tasting and explain each course carefully to make sure you will enjoy the food. Call or email them in advance if you have any dietary restriction. So proud of Chef Humm and the whole team for putting such a great effort in making this restaurant very local to New York yet being recognized by the world as the best restaurant in 2017! Keep it up, and make it nice, EMP!",0.3763077200577201,104,9.304166666666667,17.952086449130547
233,2017-10-13,3.0,"I have been super excited to try EMP, especially after the new renovations. Unfortunately, here is my honest review of the place.Before I even go into the details, let me start by saying this is indeed an amazing restaurant. But if it is deemed the best of the best, then I will hold it by those standards. It did fall short of those expectations and as such, I'm giving it a 3 star rating. It may be harsh, but you're spending a significant amount for an incredible experience so you have to be better than just better than the next guy.Pros:- Even before you get to the restaurant, someone personally reaches out to you to make sure everything is perfect. It's a great personal touch. - There were some great dishes, the lobster bisque sauce was perfect. The pretzel was amazing. I also really enjoyed the veal. - The staff is very friendly and mostly attentive. - The kitchen tour was a nice touch, especially to show off the new set upCons:- The dinner is too long. I believe it was purposely done as to not make you feel rushed but the courses had 30 minute gaps in some places. We had a 6:15 start and didn't finish until around 10:20. - The dishes were good but not amazing. I can't honestly say any one dish blew me away. - At one point, one of the servers spilled my wine glass on me. Now this wasn't a big deal on its own, as mistakes happen. It was more of how it was handled that was a bit upsetting for a restaurant of this caliber. So after she spilled the wine on my jacket, she picked up the glass and placed it back on my table. She apologized and handed me a towel.  Another member of the waitstaff also came over to help clean up and hand me additional towels. All great until I look up and see my empty and sticky wine glass sitting on the table. I'm not expecting a freebie but I've been to much lesser restaurants where they would come back with a new glass at least. At the end, I had to ask for a new one myself. Normally not a huge deal, but if you're the best restaurant in the world...Overall, EMP is a great dining establishment and anyone would be lucky to go. I am harsher on my critique as I expected to be blown away and was not. Either way, congrats on the new renovations and thank you for the great night.",0.3389379910213244,438,10.757142857142856,45.35818883192587
234,2017-10-08,5.0,Went there for hubbys  date night and was surprised on how the service was. Amazing food had the bar tasting menu and was fully satisfied. Got the kitchen tour and the manager and servers were on point. Their menu and wine pairing was perfectly complementary. Will definitely go back!

235,2017-10-06,4.0,"The restaurant, designed by Bentel & Bentel, is located in the landmark Art Deco Metropolitan Life North Building, facing Madison Square. The restaurant originally opened in 1998 and was owned by restaurateur Danny Meyer until 2011. I had my first experience at EMP in 2001. It was super expensive but so well worth it. We were seated at a table for 14 off to the side of the restaurant. Pretty private. Decor was modern and appealing. Wine and alcohol selection superb. We tried the tasting menu. It was fantastic. Food very well prepared, high quality and plentiful. No one left hungry. Service was also good. Currently they are undergoing a renovation. Will definitely visit the newly renovated space this month once they reopen.",0.23914983164983164,122,16.704166666666666,23.6153532534712
236,2017-09-15,2.0,"April 23, 201712:00 PM4 GuestsMaybe an off night? But, the worst Michelin star restaurant I have ever been to.  This is unfortunate, because I was visiting from LA, and we chose one 3 star restaurant after much research, we chose EMP. I wish I had tried per se instead. Super disappointed.  We did the tasting menu of their 12-or-14-whatever best items. Some facts:Food was not served at appropriate temperatures consistently. Luke warm chicken, almost cold center? Bad chicken, regardless. (Substitute for a red meat dish for half of the table) Needed a substitute for foie gras due to one of our diner's being pregnant. Substitute was uninspired beets cut into small squares. Beets vs foie gras...different playing field. If it were truffle something, or just something interesting and inspired, I would have appreciated the inclusion. None of us thoroughly enjoyed a single tasting menu item! All of us were extremely disappointed and quite frankly hugely surprised. So sad!!!! Really had high expectations for the best restaurant in the world. We keep telling ourselves: It must have been an off night?!",-0.061809523809523786,187,18.40666666666667,1.5778646339858824
